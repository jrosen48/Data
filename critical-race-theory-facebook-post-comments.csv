Whatever you call it, if you are teaching white kids they are oppressors and other races that they are oppressed by the oppressors (the white kids), if you are asking children to examine their privilege on a hierarchy, you‚Äôre teaching things that many parents don‚Äôt want their kids exposed to. The term ‚ÄúCRT‚Äù is a distraction. Look at the specific content being taught to the kids. What does it include? Teach the history of America, warts and all. Anything else that causes hatred of America or of other races needs to go."

You can call it Social Emotional Learning and make it sound all warm and fuzzy but you are damaging our kids. You are trying to raise activists! You act as if parents are the problem and teach kids not to listen to their parents. It‚Äôs true if your child has a strong family unit it shouldn‚Äôt matter but all these suburban kids running with Antifa were brainwashed by their school systems to think they were fighting for something good.

This is from Education Week: ""Critical race theory is an academic concept that is more than 40 years old. The core idea is that race is a social construct, and that racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice, but also something embedded in legal systems and policies.

The basic tenets of critical race theory, or CRT, emerged out of a framework for legal analysis in the late 1970s and early 1980s
created by legal scholars Derrick Bell, Kimberl√© Crenshaw, and Richard Delgado, among others.""
This is obviously too intellectual and abstract a theory to be taught in schools. It's for higher education."

The same person that blocks parents when they dont agree (very adult and clearly not the right temper for the board). Or the same person who wants to cut bussing down to only a half a mile and wants to sue the district they deem they care so much about knowing a frivolous lawsuit would cripple our district.

Is it being embedded into US history courses? PCSD is a district that NEEDS to include SOMETHING about race/racism, offer black history classes SOMETHING. How is this helping and supporting kids of color? How will PCSD support kids of color? Because with this, it shows me and many other people of color that live in the district that you don‚Äôt really care.

The comments on this thread are also absolutely disgusting and goes to show just how much race and POC history needs to be taught."

If ""standardized test scores and outdated accountability data"" are not helpful as you say above, what would WPS and the other school districts in the Commonwealth recommend as an alternative? How would they gauge performance in a way that is consistent across districts? Across the country? How should the public compare administrators,
leaders, educators? How can they measure student achievement and readiness for their next phase in life (grade advancement, college, workforce, military service, etc...)?

Schools and communities across the country are facing the same challenges. We all get it. However, some districts are clearly outperforming others. Some are struggling to reach mediocrity."

I‚Äôve witnessed how it helps our learners and staff to grow as they take responsibility for their own words and actions, as they set goals and make plans, as they learn to prioritize, as they learn to work together, as they learn to become effective and empathic listeners, and as they learn to balance all aspects of their lives.

The world doesn't need more people pretending, it needs productive members of society. (""You don't accomplish anything with a room for of Chiefs, it needs more Indians to get the work done."") WHY does this school district need a philosophy??? Teach the children reading, writing, arithmetic, TRUE history, home-ec, how to change oil or a tire, ETC. and all else will fall into place. What about freedom of choice? Can parents choose whether to allow this failed philosophy to be taught to their children? Oh wait! Choice is ONLY for approved things. My bad again! What happens when a child is marked as a ""bad leader?"" ""A group of retired teachers think that this may be a roundabout way of introducing children to Saul Alinsky or Socialist-Commu
nist ideas."" This is also teaching children a form of religion. Isn't that the parents job? (For those who don't understand quotations, it is not my words, I quoted them. Yes, I read about it and there is more to it, blah, blah blah! Nothing worth wasting my time on since this school district does not value freedom of choice, but rather encourage separation into groups.

Parents and residents who have means will if pushed beyond reason move out of the public tax base areas that they perceive as radicalized and not properly focused on job one: educating and preparing today's youth for adulthood. Similarly other families will make the monetary sacrifices necessary to remove kids from the all too often failing public education system. While CRT contains morsels of undisputed facts/data/
history it is by no means an unbiased fact based doctrine of thought/
perspective. It is highly provocative and many elements associated with CRT are essentially race-based biased propaganda dominated by special interests who have an ideological based agenda. Propagandizing American youth is a very powerful lever for these folks to pull in order to affect holistic, systemic change to the USA. If CRT and associated themes/
doctrines are worthy of consideration-s
tudy it should only be as an elective type class offering at the college level and beyond where college students are supposed to gain exposure to diverse opinions, interpretations
, world views and diverse ideology. This doctrine has no business in K-12 education-PERIO
D. The audience is too vulnerable. America spends more on public education than any other country on earth. Yet we produce the 33rd-ish best educated product and our competitiveness
continues to decline. Public schools are in trouble for many reasons and those that insist on forcing incompatible, radical ideology like CRT and similar doctrines will hopefully work themselves out of a job at some point. Show up to work. Do your job without conveyance of political, religious or racial bias and teach the fundamentals of primary and secondary education. That's it....plain and simple CRT has no place in the K-12 education process.

Battle of Bamber Bridge
Jun 24, 1943 ‚Äì Jun 25, 1943
On this day in 1943 black American soldiers faced off with white American Military police during World War II on British soil. Yes you read correctly black American soldiers had to fight their own white American soldiers, while in England, where they were fighting for the world.
Why? Because the English town of Bamber Bridge in Lancashire was not segregated so they treated the black soldiers like all other races, aka blacks were free to eat, drink anywhere, BUT back in America segregation of blacks and whites still existed. So essentially the American army went to someone else‚Äôs country and demanded they adopted America‚Äôs racist practices
So when the American Military police found out that their own black American soldiers were drinking at the same pubs as white people they went in to arrest them. The people in the town got mad about the treatment of the black soldiers and decided to then turn their pubs into ‚ÄúBLACKS ONLY DRINKING PUBS‚Äù the very opposite of what was taking place in America with their WHITES ONLY businesses.
Of course this pissed off the American military so guns went blazing, and when word spread back at camp that black soldiers had been shot, scores of men formed a crowd, some carrying rifles and by midnight more American military police arrived with a machine gun-equipped vehicle, so the black soldiers had no choice but to get rifles from British stores while others barricaded themselves back on base, so now it was American white soldiers versus American black soldiers. This lead to the death of one solider, injury of 7, and 32 convictions.
Back in America the battle was hushed up because they didn‚Äôt want the country to find out that they were fighting their own soldiers which would anger the black population and weaken the morale in the country.
You may read about the ill treatment of black American soldiers by their own army in the book FORGOTTEN."

And this is why we now have CRT in our public school systems, because nobody recognizes it as a Marxist doctrine. But that‚Äôs exactly what CRT is. This is by design. Academia has always been in love with Marxist ideology. The school imposing their will on the subject further exemplifies this. If you can‚Äôt see this as a Marxist ideology, your school system failed you, and you need to read. ALOT.

Marxism is not the same as Communism.

Marxism is the study of how the aristocracy strives to preserve their place in society. The bourgeoise want to be the aristocracy, so they strive to keep the proletariat in their place.

That‚Äôs a very simple summary, but it‚Äôs a social construct that we actually do see in America in different ways‚Ä¶ for instance, the occupy wall street movement several years ago, ‚Äúwe are the 99%‚Äù. Did the 1%, the aristocracy of America, actually change anything? Not really. Why would they? They don‚Äôt want to surrender their position. Would you?

Making students aware of the existence of this social theory is not the same as indoctrination."

I would be careful listening to Gordon Midgley who clearly believes anything he reads on the internet, even when the information conflicts with itself. Gordon, if you can't hang in a conversation and need to do a snowflake thing and attempt to rat, maybe take your Mainstream conservative media mind, who's thought process is handed to em by politicians and crappy journalists, to your basement and just eat worthers candy watching gun smoke and or happy days.

I'm proud of the bravery the kids showed speaking in favor while grown adults yelled and made fun of them. I have hope that we can find commonality as just parents who freaking love our kids. And want the best for our kids. And no matter what they learn at school, what we teach them at home they will carry with them for the rest of their life. Who here remembers the homework assignment they had in a class junior year? Now who would remember if you had a grown man yell at you as a sixteen year old girl telling you that you were a facist? I would. Our kids are watching THIS way more than they will pay attention in this elective class."

People of color were revered and respected when I was in school. This was way back in the late 90s to 2003. I wish wish wish there were more people of color around me when I was growing up. You don‚Äôt get to know THEIR struggles. I‚Äôve been so indoctrinated growing up, and African American studies should be an option for study or how will all of we white people surrounded by mostly white people EVER understand what we, ourselves never went through? It is a definite, undeniable part of ALL of our histories as Americans. To deny a child the option to learn about something in their own history as an American human is almost blasphemous. I‚Äôm 37 now, and I don‚Äôt ever want my little girl to grow up with simple and plain IGNORANCE about other races and make assumptions. I teach her now that we are all children of God(public school, but relevant for us, personally), all of us. I feel, as a white woman, removing these class options is similar to what I‚Äôve only heard about, segregation and wanting to just sweep this little blip in ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù education under the rug. EMBRACE TRUTH AND END THIS SAD BATTLE. This is a good option for our children. I‚Äôm proud it‚Äôs finally here, in this CRUEL and entitled community, of which I‚Äôve also grown up in. I‚Äôm embarrassed to see the parents my age around here now. Just vindictive. Something has got to change around here! If we‚Äôre not moving forward, I believe we‚Äôre just going to stand still.

That being said, the board just agreed to adopt social emotional learning curriculum, which is often a component of CRT. I think more transparency surrounding curriculum and DEI initiatives is imperative to finding a positive way forward and resolving a great deal of tension surrounding this concern.

I want all our children to feel supported and confident, without painting any of them as oppressive or oppressed. This would go a long way toward supporting mental health in a way that is realistic for schools."

Many parents voiced their fears about CRT at the meeting, as well as on numerous posts, but have not stated specific examples where it has been, or will be taught in schools. If you fear aspects of CRT being taught, or have concerns about DEI, talk to those who feel it is essential, as well as listen to the experiences of those who were bullied and treated unequally.

Also, if your child has an IEP, that is an example of equity- providing an Individualized education plan, to help your child achieve success. It‚Äôs not all about race."

https://facebook.com/148341361326/posts/10159156205556327/posts/10159156205556327,"I believe some of the current curriculum needs to be reviewed and restructured prior to on boarding any new curriculum additions. Some of the current curriculum is inappropriate for the aged children it is targeting. For example: the Black History Month curriculum for First Grade students is too detailed and in-depth. First grade students should not be exposed to the content on that level. In our home we do not teach our children to see color as a difference. Our son was highly upset that a little girl and her mother would have had things thrown at them and received threats of violence because she went to school. We had to open up conversations with our 7 year old first grader who was not ready for that content. Yes, the topics and historical achievements need to be introduced, however they do not need to include the description of violence at this age level. Why not teach the celebration of the historical achievement and the bravery of those involved? The children‚Äôs takeaway is the violence and that people are/were bad‚Ä¶ not the bravery and accomplishment.

You aren‚Äôt teaching the First Grade children about the massacres that took place against the Native Peoples of our nation or the Trail of Tears. Likewise, the atrocities surrounding WWII, the Holocaust and the State Side Japanese Internment Camps are not taught at this age level so why include the violence surrounding Black History to these children? It is wholly inappropriate at this age level and something that the parents should be made aware of and therefore able to broach the subject at home. We do teach our children about these subjects and more as they are very important to us. That being said, we keep the content age appropriate. The Pennsylvania School System and DASD‚Äôs needs someone to take a hard look at their curriculum."

We live in a global world people. It is a sign of an educated society. We ALL should learn how to to be inclusive and empathetic. How will you do that if you don‚Äôt learn and understand diversity? For those who oppose it so vehemently, do you feel your power being lessened? Does uplifting someone else make you weaker? Reading the hatred here by parents explains why their children become bullies in school. You can say you are not racist, homophobic, or discriminatory on any other basis until you are blue in the face but denying others the right to equal opportunity and respect is the most unAmerican thing to do."

I wasn't taught about Emmett Till or Juneteenth. My history books in the 90s in Illinois taught me that the Civil War was about State's rights and not slavery. I didn't learn true history until recently. I don't hate myself for being white knowing all that but I understand better my responsibility to do better because now I know better. And I want that for my kids.

We have made progress, but there are still so many things that were established to create better for some, and less for others, like putting highways near certain neighborhoods, and less traffic noise near others.
No one is saying that current students created this division, only that we need to figure out where the division is, and how to make things better for those who have less advantages. For those who fear studying racism, and helping students with equality, ask those who still face hurtful comments and treatment- 9/11 led to hate crimes against people, as did COVID. It doesn‚Äôt have to be physical attacks, or the viral videos- there are so many subtle beliefs and sayings we accept, that need to be called out and corrected."

How and why on a systemic level other school districts in Pennsylvania look different and why their experiences are different. Why all but one of my teachers from kindergarten through senior year were white. Why black history was taught on a surface level only one month out of the year. We would learn about historic events in civil rights but we would not use those as a context to discuss the modern day. Rather, the messaging was mostly ‚Äúand that fixed things!‚Äù Critical Race Theory only sounds scary if you‚Äôre afraid to learn that the game you‚Äôre playing is rigged in favor of your complexion and you might need to live with some discomfort in order to make the changes that ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion. I‚Äôm disappointed that 10 years after I graduated the district is still afraid to fully embrace honest and truthful education.

The ideology that is called Critical Race Theory is found throughout the curriculum of an elementary school in the school district. It might not be taught as ""social studies"" directly but it permeates the teaching methodology of at least one elementary school in the CCISD. I examined Faye Webb Elementary school 2020-2021 Campus Improvement Plan(CIP). On page 5 it violates basic educational policy by comparing students across racial lines in: ""Problem Statement 1 (prioritized): There is a gap in the performance of Hispanic, Economically Disadvantaged and Special Education students when compared to White students across all content areas."" This problem statement is congruent with basic CRT ideology. Whites as ""oppressors"" can not be economically disadvantaged or special education students. Thus under CRT ideology such a comparison is justified. It is not under the concept of treating students equally regardless of their race. Further, this thinking permeates the CIP of Faye Webb elementary. On page 20 under ""Strategy 1 Details"" it elaborates how teachers are to employ different teaching strategies based on the student's race. On page 27 of the CIP under ""Performance Objective1: . . .all teachers will provide Social Emotional Learning opportunities weekly through use of Second Step Program."" Both Social Emotional Learning and the Second Step Program are critical race theory based educational programs. While each may have some laudable teaching methods within them, these programs are guided by the heavy handed racism of critical race theory or culturally responsive teaching. Here is a quote from the Second Step website: ""We're committed to addressing racial injustice and helping you drive real change in your school communities."" To quote from the Committee for Children concerning Social Emotional Learning: ""social emotional learning (SEL) is fundamental to achieving social justice. We are dedicated to advancing diversity equity, and inclusion (DEI), to becoming an anti-racist organization"" CCISD is allowing the basic ideology of CRT to be employed in the teaching methods they are using at Faye Webb Elementary school. For CCISD to say the phrase CRT does not appear in the social studies lessons might be true. To say that basic CRT ideology is not central to most of the teaching that goes at one of their elementary schools is not true. We the people of Corpus Christi do not send our children to school to be indoctrinated into race hatred that separates children by race and instructs teachers to teach them differently due to their race. We do not send our children to be indoctrinated into false concepts of ""social justice"" and ""anti-racism"" that are actually the opposites of their labels-injustic
e and racism. Faye Webb Elementary and any school that shares a similar CIP plan will be in violation of HB3979 when it goes into effect on 1 September. HB3979 does not mention CRT. It forbids the teaching of racism in our schools. This is a serious problem and it requires much more from CCISD than a misleading statement."

CRT is legal studies paradigm NOT taught in K-12.

CRT concepts get incorporated through a plethora of OTHER ways, namely (CA)SEL (social emotional learning) framework and various DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) staff development trainings. All of those sound pretty good if you don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs about.

ve masking children is (harming their health, inhibiting learning, creating needless fear, limiting social interactions...
), why are masks still being mandated? I am seriously asking. I have only heard the perspectives of people wanting to have the option to decide if their children wear them or not. What is the evidence that SSD has for masking children for 7+hours a day, 5 days a week?"

As far as I know, he has mandated that every educator be taught CRT. The likely result of this would be that it would find it‚Äôs way into the classroom. Not OK."
https://facebook.com/136141411096/posts/10157736871196097/posts/10157736871196097,"You cannot on one hand say, Snohomish does not teach Critical Race Theory (CRT) and then follow with the following statement, ""Snohomish School District strives for equity through the efforts of removing all barriers to learning..."" Did Snohomish just hire a Director of Equity and Inclusion? Yes, at the same meeting where they agreed to spend our tax dollars on 1 electric school bus for $400,000! The bedrock of critical race theory (i.e. Marxism-Leninis
m i.e Communism) is equity of outcomes. Your actions belie your statements, you are attempting to pull a slight of hand so parents aren't busting down the doors of the school board meetings while you indoctrinate their children. Marx famously said, ""give me one generation of your kids and I'll change the world.""

Here's the deal parents and community members, it's not that the school board or superintendent is trying to implement this, they're pawns doing what they're told, they're too dumb to know the dangers of what they're doing. They're not researched, they passingly acknowledge these mandates and shrug their shoulders without bothering to understand the damage. Mukilteo schools are about 18 months down this CRT road, it started with the hiring of a director of equity, and now after their Wednesday staff meetings they are sent 2 links for the teachers to go to their ""affinity groups,"" one for the white teachers and one for the BIPOC teachers. If you don't think in 6 months this will happen in Snohomish, well you're exactly where they want you. Uninvolved and ignorant to the destruction ahead. This is your warning, over to you to hold these pawns accountable. I'm not even going to get started with the comprehensive sexual education or unscientific masking of our kids. We homeschooled for the last 2 years which was a gigantic sacrifice.

This is your problem now but remember this comment when you don't even recognize your kids or hear the nonsense they'll be bringing home. We're officially leaving this communist state for a place that mandates freedom and not tyranny. It's sad because we love (d) Snohomish and thought it was our forever place but we want our kids to be bold, not kowtow to wokeism and be led by the ignorant fools of our school board. Take care"

If you don't provide sexual health content in those grades, why the need to opt out? More word games to confuse parents and push their agenda. Equity training (another word for CRT) is required for all teachers which will eventually be taught in classrooms. Children have a near zero chance of catching, spreading or dying from the virus so the masks and push for the shots on kids are not for anyone's health. The district needs to provide the data backing up their ""mandates""."

When my kids were in IWCS up until last year you did and my kids enjoyed them..This is all just blatant PR and it‚Äôs pathetic. Just focus on teaching them how to read (less sight words and more phonics!), classic literature, real history and non common core math. You‚Äôre not their parents- you‚Äôre their educators- do your frickin‚Äô job instead of trying to make them ‚Äòfeel good‚Äô all the time. Don‚Äôt have lower expectations for some kids who look a certain way- that‚Äôs actually racist and doesn‚Äôt help them in the long run and sets them up for failure in the real world. Expect excellence from every student no matter their color or immutable characteristics
and they will rise to the occasion! Your trendy ‚ÄòEquity‚Äô push doesn‚Äôt do that and unfortunately lowers the bar for some kids and makes them feel if you don‚Äôt think they can be treated equally then there certainly must be something wrong with them which damages the very kids you‚Äôre trying to help. And in our experience when some kids are ahead of the curve and very motivated some of your teachers try to hold them back because they don‚Äôt want others ‚Äòfeeling bad‚Äô about themselves because they‚Äôre not doing as well.
