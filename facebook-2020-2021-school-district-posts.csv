the news and will be presented for discussion.

I‚Äôm very happy to be here and believe my extensive leadership experience, which stretches back nearly 28 years, will be of real assistance in tackling some of the district‚Äôs systems issues which require immediate attention. I have spent the better portion of my first seven weeks trying to fill key leadership positions which were vacated this past spring and summer. Bit by bit, a new leadership team has been onboarding over the last month and our team is now fully intact. This was the first priority to tackle upon my entry, and I‚Äôm very pleased with the quality of candidates we have managed to bring into our learning community. During my short time here, we have found some specific operational systems utilized in business, payroll and human resources in recent years have either been inadequate, lacking appropriate checks and balances, or simply not following best practices for a nearly $40 million organization. To this end, I have spent a great deal of time digging deeper into how and why these systems were either not set up and administered properly, or fixing mistakes generated by a lack of a strategic approach to operations. This is all fixable, but it requires an initial investment of time, during which our new leadership team will thoroughly review files and systems, address and correct errors, and establish clear, redundant protocols and feedback loops for payroll, business and HR operations to run smoothly moving forward. Since my arrival, I have met with various staff members, become acquainted with the people with whom I‚Äôm working and have gotten to know the board. Because we have needed to onboard so many new people, I‚Äôm also spending time either directly mentoring individuals or reaching out to experienced individuals in neighboring districts or school support organizations to assist in advising some of our new hires. At recent board meetings, I‚Äôve referred to this as triage work and I‚Äôve advised the board that most of my first nine to 10 months on the job will center on this. I have also been asked to recruit someone into the district whom I can mentor to replace me at the end of the 2022-2023 school year, as I prepare to retire. I know some community members are concerned about whether the district intends to revisit the diversity and equity initiative which began last school year. Concerns were raised at a recent board meeting that the district had spent some $500,000 on diversity and equity curriculum and resources. Let me be clear: that DID NOT happen. Someone must have either been confused about a budget discussion on overall K-12 curriculum and professional development and textbook purchasing, or had their own agenda and spread false information. The bottom line is that SMSD has not expended $500,000 on diversity and equity initiatives. Regarding my stance on the formal JEDI initiative that began last school year, and was apparently tabled in the spring or early summer prior to my arrival, I ask that everyone refers to the priorities I‚Äôve discussed in the first three paragraphs of this letter. In the immediate future, my focus is on fixing fundamental operations, preparing to develop a budget for next fiscal year, helping the district find its next superintendent, and working with my new leadership team to prioritize areas in need of immediate correction and fix them. After that, we will develop and implement long-term practices to ensure those areas function properly, well into the future. These areas of priority will occupy almost all of my time and the time of my core leadership team for the remainder of this school year. Finally, regarding curriculum content: public schools are governed by Chapter 4 of the PA School Code of 1949. Over the years, there have been periodic updates to Chapter 4, which outlines what must be included in district curricular content. I have been a superintendent for nearly 18 years, and at no time during that span do I recall any update to Chapter 4 requiring public schools to teach Critical Race Theory as part of our curriculum‚Äîthough for many, many years, there have been historical references in our guidelines for including discussion and analysis of domestic unrest, and racial and ethnic tension. If CRT had been mandated, every superintendent and curriculum director in the state would have received formal notification of this change‚Äîthat has not happened, nor is it ever likely to happen. Unfortunately, social media, media punditry and rabid politics have enabled susceptible individuals to be duped into linking any attempt to address concepts like diversity, racial bigotry, marginalization, or inequitable treatment of sub-groups to the so-called culture wars and government indoctrination of children. Here is a link to Chapter 4 on the PA Department of Education website: (truncated)",http://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/Display/pacode?file=%2Fsecure%2Fpacode%2Fdata%2F022%2Fchapter4%2Fchap4toc.html&d,NA,NA,022,"Information included at this site has been derived directly from the Pennsylvania Code, the Commonwealth's official publication of rules and regulations and from the Pennsylvania Bulletin, the Commonwealth's official gazette for information and rulemaking",NA,NA,NA,2.12,TRUE,TRUE

forum to address various aspects of our program including curriculum offerings, current
mandates and policies and procedures that impact day-to-day operations.
These are challenging times, as we deal with an ongoing pandemic, legislative updates and the
latest Executive Orders that impact our schools. Questions surrounding topics such as Critical
Race Theory, Gender Identity, and issues relating to social and sexual health have been making
the news and will be presented for discussion.
We will also discuss current initiatives surrounding school operations and student behavior
including vaping, general student conduct and attendance/tardiness.
In an effort to ensure that we have the available space and in response to requests for a more convenient time, the Open Public Forum to address various aspects of our school program will now be held at the Ocean City Free Public Library Lecture Hall at 1735 Simpson Avenue.

The start time for the forum has been changed from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and, because the forum is being held off of the school property, masks will be optional.

We look forward to your attendance as we seek to address important issues facing our schools. Please be reminded that if you have any specific questions you would like us to address you can share them HERE

 

If you have any questions regarding these changes, please reach out the Superintendent‚Äôs office.

While we hoped that this year would allow for a return to normal, that has unfortunately not been the case. The pandemic continues to challenge school districts with positive cases, contract tracing, and quarantine protocols. Schools around the country are also coping with a sharp increase in mental health concerns as well as teacher and staffing shortages. As the school year progresses, it has become clear that many students are struggling nationwide. The crisis in mental health has been growing for years, but the pandemic has accelerated it. Students are facing a number of challenges that are affecting their mental health, including feelings of isolation and anxiety, substance and alcohol use, and the unexpected deaths of loved ones from COVID-19. In response to this, our district has not only expanded our partnership with River Valley Counseling Center, but we have also added eight School Adjustment Counselor positions across our schools to help meet the needs of our students. We know that if our students are not in a healthy mental state, that they cannot adequately access our curriculum, which directly affects student achievement. The COVID pandemic has triggered a spike in teacher retirements and resignations. In addition to teacher vacancies, schools around the country are facing food supply shortages, and struggle to find enough bus drivers, paraprofessionals, custodians and cafeteria workers. Many districts also face shortages of substitute teachers, who are needed now more than ever to cover for teachers who are out sick or quarantined. Some schools have closed when too many positions could not be filled, while others grapple with higher than normal unfilled positions, leaving remaining staff overworked. The lack of qualified teachers in the US has worsened during the pandemic. Difficulties filling teacher openings continue to affect schools across the country. In South Dakota, one district started the school year with 120 teacher vacancies. In Texas, districts in Houston, Waco and other neighborhoods reported teacher vacancies in the hundreds as the school year began. Florida is short over 5000 teachers across the state. Our district still has over a dozen critical positions to fill and it‚Äôs already the middle of October. The teacher shortage didn't start with COVID-19. Educators have been leaving the profession for years for a variety of reasons, and the pandemic only exacerbated the situation. According to a June survey of 2,690 members of the National Education Association, 32% said the pandemic was likely to make them leave the profession earlier than expected. Over the last 18 months, teacher workloads have increased considerably along with stress levels. In May, a survey by the CDC Foundation reported that 27% of teachers reported depression and 37% reported anxiety. Further complicating the staff shortages is the fact that fewer students are majoring in education at college and universities. With election season upon us, it is my hope that candidates running for public office realize the actual issues facing our school system. As a community, we need to collaborate to solve the ongoing mental health crisis and lack of qualified school staffing. Schools nationwide have had to shut down classrooms because there just aren‚Äôt enough teachers. While this has not happened in Westfield yet, that day may come. Critics focusing on standardized test scores and outdated accountability data during a global pandemic is not helpful. Debating about masks or the myth that Critical Race Theory is being taught in our schools is equally nonproductive. If we truly hope to work together to create an environment where children can learn and thrive and be surrounded by positive role models and examples in their community, we need to acknowledge that our world is hurting, traumatized, and in need of healing. We also need to celebrate the good work that our educators, administrators, support staff and families do every day caring for our children.",https://www.facebook.com/WestfieldMAPublicSchools/photos/a.577807808931222/4707381605973801/?type=3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3.78,FALSE,TRUE

Hartford Changemakers 
Olga M. Alfaro Mele (1917-2003)
Puerto Rican Community Advocate - social services, religious leader
Mele was born in Guayama, Puerto Rico, daughter of the late Pedro and Ramona (Gutierrez) Alfaro and moved to Connecticut in 1941, one of the first Puerto Ricans in Hartford, laying the foundation of pioneering social services for the Puerto Rican community in Hartford. Mele began her involvement in the community through her dedication to Puerto Rican migrant worker in the 1950s, teaching them about nutrition and health services. She was the co-founder of the San Juan Center and a longtime Community Renewal Team family and job counselor. She went out of her way to support her community for employment opportunities. Many a time police officers would stop her and threaten to give her a ticket for bringing so many people in her car. But Mele always responded, ""but what am I going to do? They don't have transportation and they don't have jobs and I am the only person who has transportation and who knows where these jobs are.""
Mele was a devout Catholic and very involved in making sure there were religious leadership opportunities for Puerto Ricans in Hartford. She was a member of the St. Peter's Church Ladies Auxiliaries, St. Peter's Prayer group, and the Larabee Foundation of Hartford Commission on Aging. She received numerous city, state, and national awards in the 1970s -1990s for her pioneering community work for the Puerto Rican community and beyond. When she received the Jefferson Award  from the American Institute for Public Service in 1977, she said ""Give and give freely, for I am living proof that in giving you do receive, if not in public recognition, in the joys which come from helping others help themselves."" Her awards include (see below):

Muchas veces la polic√≠a la deten√≠an y la amenazaban con multarla por llevar a tanta gente en su coche. Pero Mele siempre respondi√≥, ""pero ¬øqu√© voy a hacer? No tienen transporte y no tienen trabajo y yo soy la √∫nica persona que tiene transporte y que sabe d√≥nde est√°n esos trabajos."" 
Mele era un cat√≥lico devoto y estaba muy involucrado en asegurarse de que hubiera oportunidades de liderazgo religioso para los puertorrique√±os en Hartford.

The revision of Policy 7720 - Employee Political Activities was considered for a first read by the Board of Education members. The policy revision included the following statement: This policy should not be construed as prohibiting the impartial study and discussion of political or other controversial issues in the classroom setting, including the dissemination of factual information about serious problems the school system or the community may be facing because of political actions, where such teaching or information reasonably relates to the standards of the course. Both sides of the political issue shall be presented, supported by primary or balanced secondary sources so that students are provided an opportunity to be well informed and to be able to make their own decisions regarding political or other controversial issues. Further, this policy shall ensure that social theories of any kind (i.e. Holocaust Denial Theory, 9/11 Theory, Critical Race Theory) are not presented to students unless approved by the Carteret County Board of Education. It is the responsibility of the Board to ensure that curricular standards are taught using well documented, factual resources and not opinion or conjecture. The Carteret County Public School System does not teach Critical Race Theory, nor are there any plans to do so in the future. The Carteret County Board of Education promotes respect for all persons and encourages school system personnel to incorporate this foundational concept in all instructional activities. Students should be encouraged to think critically, freely, and with a respect for differences of opinion. The Board rejects any curriculum, instructional activity, or instructional resource that devalues any person. The school system‚Äôs frequent expression of ‚Äú#CarteretStrong‚Äù is predicated upon the belief that we are ‚Äú#StrongerTogether.‚Äù Superintendent Dr. Rob Jackson gave a detailed PowerPoint presentation on NCDHHS StrongSchoolsNC Public Health Toolkit for kindergarten through 12th grade, which included updates on toolkit revisions, educational experience for students, health and wellness protocols, transportation, child nutrition, cloth face coverings, and quarantine guidelines. Dr. Jackson met with the Health Director and other health officials from the Carteret County Health Department prior to the meeting to ensure the information being presented was accurate and up-to-date. The StrongSchoolsNC Public Health Toolkit states, ‚ÄúIf a school does not require individuals who are not fully vaccinated to wear a mask, they should ensure a layered mitigation strategy, including physical distancing, ventilation, hand hygiene, adequate access to diagnostic and screening testing, and closely monitor for increases in COVID-19 cases.‚Äù Board members reiterated the priority placed on the health and safety of students and staff and the importance of students attending school face-to-face.

Likewise, Colonial Heights Public Schools has not changed its policies regarding transgender students. We do not discriminate in our schools and will continue to work with students needing support on an individual basis and respect their privacy, in an environment that is safe and respectful of all students.

Springboro Schools has not and will not support or implement CRT into our curriculum at any grade level. Additionally, our curriculum will not include the following topics that are sometimes associated with CRT: ‚Ä¢ Teaching from a perspective that the United States and/or its legal system is systematically racist and designed to create and maintain inequalities between genders, ethnicities, different religious heritages, or races ‚Ä¢ Teaching that socialism and communism are morally superior to democracy, capitalism, and a free market economy ‚Ä¢ That any gender, ethnicity, religious heritage, or race should feel superior or inferior ‚Ä¢ That one should feel guilt or shame due to their ethnicity, religious heritage, race, or gender Springboro Schools follows the Ohio Department of Education‚Äôs (ODE) Learning Standards. Those standards for social studies were reviewed and adopted in 2018, and do not include CRT.

Two common questions being asked are 1) What is Critical Race Theory? and 2) Is it being taught in our schools? What Is Critical Race Theory? Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a phrase that is frequently mentioned in the media and in public conversations. CRT might have a certain meaning to one person while someone else might believe it is something entirely different. But the most basic purpose of Critical Race Theory, which originated in the 1970s, was as an analytical tool for law students to examine the impact of historical and present-day racism on the legal system and public policies. Currently, CRT is primarily used by higher education in the study of law, psychology, and sociology. Is Critical Race Theory in the Missouri Learning Standards? The tenets of CRT are not part of social studies or any other learning standards in Missouri. The state‚Äôs social studies standards can be found on the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education‚Äôs website (Missouri Social Studies Learning Standards). It‚Äôs important to remember that all Missouri Learning Standards are approved by the State Board of Education and developed by Missouri educators, parents, and other community stakeholders selected by the President Pro Tem of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the State Board of Education, the Commissioner of DESE, the Commissioner of Higher Education and various education associations. (Section 160.514, RSMo.) Is Critical Race Theory the Same as Educational Equity? No. Various media channels and members of the public sometimes use terms interchangeably when they mean two different things. The terms Critical Race Theory and educational equity are not the same. Unlike CRT, which, again, is a tool primarily used in institutions of higher education, educational equity is a K-12 term referring to federal and state policies and requirements. Specifically, the term is closely associated with ‚ÄúNo Child Left Behind‚Äù (NCLB) legislation that was led by former President George W. Bush and signed into law in 2002. This federal law established clear requirements for school districts to not only disaggregate student achievement data by race but also to close achievements gaps where they exist. In recent years, the terms equity work or diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become commonplace in K-12 education as many districts revisit and renew their local efforts to close achievement gaps as required by the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). When signed into law in 2015, ESSA further advanced equity in U.S. education policy by upholding protections outlined in NCLB, including calling for comprehensive state-developed plans designed to close achievement gaps, improve the quality of instruction, and increase outcomes for all students. The state's accreditation system, MSIP (the Missouri School Improvement Program), includes provisions to address educational equity in Missouri‚Äôs schools. These rules were reviewed by Missouri‚Äôs Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, which is a 10-member legislative committee made up of six Republicans and four Democrats from the Missouri House and Senate. Further, the Secretary of State received comments from the public on the proposed rules and the State Board of Education considered the comments prior to final approval. Is Critical Race Theory the Same as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)? No. The focus of DEI is to ensure all students have the opportunity to receive a quality education and are provided the resources they need in order to allow for their success. We hope you find this information helpful as questions arise about this topic. www.mosba.org:=:https://www.mosba.org/ | 800.221.6722 | info@mosba.org | 2100 I-70 Drive Southwest Columbia, MO 65203",https://www.mosba.org/,NA,NA,Home,Helping School Boards Ensure All Students Succeed COVID-19 Resources MSBA Resources for the COVID-19 Pandemic,NA,NA,NA,-22,TRUE,TRUE

The number one thing to know is that what has been taught at Morgan County R-II will continue to be taught at Morgan County R-II. To address possible misunderstandings: - We are not adopting Critical Race Theory (or something similar) and we are also not changing words used to sneak in a political agenda or a particular program under a different name. That is not who we are. We will always be transparent about what children are learning in the classrooms and always look for ways to do better when we can. Critical Race Theory (CRT) is not a part of the social studies or any other curriculum, or in the Missouri State Standards, and we have no plan on changing that. CRT is an analytical tool that is used at the university level for evaluating the legal system and is not appropriate for the K-12 curriculum. - We do not have any classes that teach students to be ethnically a certain way. (The example asked about has been ‚Äì ‚Äúteaching students to be less white‚Äù. That is not and will not be a class.) - We do not have any classes that teach students about their gender roles and responsibilities. (The example asked about has been ‚Äì ‚Äúteaching boys to be more effeminate‚Äù. That is not and will not be a class.) In summary, the curriculum your children have learned in the past is the same curriculum that will be in place next year. We are aligned directly with the Missouri State Standards, and if you ever have questions about our curriculum, please do not hesitate to call the Central Office at 573-378-4231 or contact your building principal.

Snohomish School District strives for equity through the efforts of removing all barriers to learning and by doing so seeks to honor and value the lives of each and every student, staff, and community member regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, neurodiversity, social class or disability. Masks/face coverings The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Washington State Department of Health, the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) and Snohomish Health District have all noted masks are currently required for all individuals in the school setting (K-12). The district must follow the student health and safety requirements mandated by these entities. This is a state mandate that our neighboring school districts all follow as well. As we work through the summer, we fully anticipate that guidance from federal, state and local health partners may be changing regarding many of the COVID-19 health and safety aspects. Although we have no advance notice of what those changes may be, we will adapt accordingly and throughout the summer district teams will work to prepare our schools, classrooms and spaces to accommodate full, in-person enrollment. We will communicate any changes as soon as we are made aware. Sexual education curriculum Our district offers human growth and development curriculum to students in 5th through 9th grades. Our adopted curriculum used in the classroom, which is available at www.sno.wednet.edu/healtheducation,:=:https://www.sno.wednet.edu:443/healtheducation, went through our public review process which includes community meetings and input. In addition, each time the curriculum is taught we are required to have community meetings so families have the information before instruction so they can decide whether to opt their child out of the lessons. Senate Bill 5395, passed by the Legislature and the voters in 2020, took effect on December 3, 2020. It requires all Washington public schools to provide comprehensive sexual health education instruction that is medically and scientifically accurate, evidence-informed, age-appropriate, aligned with health and learning standards, and inclusive of all students regardless of their protected class status. The bill defines comprehensive sexual health education as recurring instruction in human development and reproduction that is age-appropriate and inclusive of all students. The bill maintains the right for parents/guardians to opt their children out of sexual health education instruction at any time. According to the requirements of Senate Bill 5395: Beginning in the 2021‚àí22 school year ‚Ä¢ Schools must begin providing comprehensive sexual health education at least twice between grades 6‚àí8 and at least twice between grades 9‚àí12. For example, to meet the requirements for grades 6‚Äì8, schools may choose to provide instruction once in grade 6 and once in grade 8. The instruction must also include age-appropriate information about affirmative consent and bystander training. ‚Ä¢ Schools must inform the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) of any curricula used to provide comprehensive sexual health education and describe how their instruction aligns with the requirements of the bill. ‚Ä¢The Snohomish School District adopted human growth and development curriculum used in our 6th through 9th grade classrooms is available at www.sno.wednet.edu/healtheducation.:=:https://www.sno.wednet.edu:443/healtheducation. Opt out is available for anyone who does not want to participate. Beginning in the 2022‚àí23 school year ‚Ä¢ Schools must provide social emotional learning (SEL) to students in grades K‚àí3. There is no sexual health content required for students in grades K‚Äì3. ‚Ä¢ Schools must begin providing comprehensive sexual health education at least once between grades 4‚àí5.

Something has happened that was long overdue in our nation, and I want to celebrate it with the entire district. Congress passed and then President Joe Biden signed into law a federal holiday on June 19th, or Juneteenth, commemorating the end of enslavement in the United States. June 19, 1865 is the day that ‚ÄúUnion Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation,‚Äù according to CNN. Texas became the final state to end enslavement. Juneteenth is a day that Black people have long celebrated, but that many other Americans know little to nothing about. But as it‚Äôs now recognized as a federal holiday, that will change, and I look forward to adding more information about the holiday and its history to our curriculum. To keep things real here, we as a nation simply have not properly confronted our past crimes against humanity that took place during a 250 year period in the form of human bondage, abuse, and murder. It‚Äôs long past time that our country honors the lives lost to enslavement and all the people who survived it to see their emancipation, and celebrates the triumph over this evil system that built so much of our country and its wealth through the enslavement of millions of Black lives. Of course, this move by Congress and President Biden comes amid a national reckoning with issues of race, and a terrible spike in racist behavior. It also comes as some people across the country fight against efforts to teach ‚Äúcritical race theory,‚Äù which gives a direct and honest accounting of the history of race and racism in our society. Martin Luther King, Jr. reminded us that ‚Äúthe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.‚Äù This is one more important curve toward justice for everyone, but we still have a long way to go. Now, as the signing of the bill by the president comes just two days before the holiday it proclaims, we, the District, are unable to facilitate the holiday for our staff this year. So, Friday, June 18 is a normal work and summer learning day in OUSD. Even though tomorrow is still a work and school day in OUSD, I want to wish everyone in our community a wonderful, thoughtful, and reflective Juneteenth on Saturday as we work toward a more just society for all.

Phase one includes toxic substances and household hazardous waste
 
VISALIA, CA ‚Äì The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) is working with the County Resource Management Agency, the Environmental Health Division, and other County officials to begin phase one of the cleanup process on November 3 for residences damaged or destroyed by the SQF Complex, at no cost to property owners. 
 
This phase of debris-removal efforts includes the processing and disposal of household hazardous waste and toxic waste on-site at no cost to the property owner. The effort is expected to last three to four weeks, with work taking place Monday‚ÄìFriday, but is dependent on available daylight, weather conditions, the amount of material to be removed, and other factors.
 
Disposal of hazardous waste ensures the public health of those returning to the area and prepares affected properties for phase two, which involves the more comprehensive removal of debris. Property owners who choose to begin property cleanup themselves outside of the federal process may lose out on federal funding but will still be subject to proper cleanup standards.
 
Crews will remove electronic waste, such as: microwave ovens; LCD, plasma, and CRT displays; stereo components; copiers; phones and answering machines; VCRs, DVD/Blu-Ray players, computers, laptops, and routers (home network equipment); and calculators.

Crews will also remove household hazardous wastes, including paint; pesticides; aerosol cans; fire extinguishers; pool chemicals; propane cylinders at or less than 30 gallons (e.g., BBQ tanks); intact compressed gas cylinders; ammunition smaller than .50 caliber; batteries; suspected asbestos-containing materials; and fluorescent light ballasts. 
 
County, state, and federal officials are actively working on the phase-two program. More details on phase two, including the required forms to participate in that phase, are expected in the coming days. Individuals with damaged or destroyed properties who have not yet contacted the County via the Local Assistance Center or SQF Complex Hotline are encouraged to do so. Affected individuals are also encouraged to register with FEMA by November 23 for potential federal assistance. 
 
For assistance, visit the local assistance center at 1055 W. Henderson in Porterville Monday‚ÄìFriday 8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. and weekends 9:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m. or call the hotline at (559) 802-9790.

Meet Master Deputy Robert ‚ÄúClint‚Äù Cromwell, proud alumnus and member of the Francis Scott Key High School family.  M/D Cromwell is a 1992 graduate of the school named after the local native Francis Scott Key, who authored our nation‚Äôs anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner.

M/D Cromwell‚Äôs lineage reflects generations of military service in multiple branches of our country‚Äôs defense.  Among these were his grandfathers, uncles, cousins and his father.  M/D Cromwell followed in his father‚Äôs footsteps and enlisted in the Marine Corps as an eleventh grader at FSK HS in 1991.  

While serving in the Marine Reserves for six years out of Fort Detrick, MD, at age 21, he joined the Taneytown Police Department.  Finally, in 1998 he lateraled to the CCSO serving in the Patrol Unit.  M/D Cromwell received Deputy of the Year in 1999 and is on the CRT (Crisis Response Team) working in tandem with CCSO‚Äôs SWAT.

A dad to three school-aged children, M/D Cromwell grew increasing concerned about active assailant incidents in our nation‚Äôs schools.  ‚ÄúI wanted to be able to do something about it,‚Äù said Cromwell.  When the full-time positions opened at three of Carroll County‚Äôs high schools, he jumped at the chance to serve his alma mater.  ‚ÄúI went to school with a lot of the parents of these kids and my number one priority is to protect the students.‚Äù  

M/D Cromwell likes to show the kids, who are still forming their own views about law enforcement, that police officers can help them in a positive context, not just during a negative situation.   In addition to guest speaking in their classes about alcohol, traffic stop, and internet safety, he loves to encourage the kids to push themselves in life to discover abilities they may not know they have.  ‚ÄúI tell them, you can do things you didn‚Äôt think you could do, your body is stronger than you think it is, if you‚Äôre not exposed to adversity, then you will never know what you‚Äôre capable of.‚Äù 

M/D Cromwell loves the outdoors.  He frequently fishes with his dad and kids at a park in Taneytown.",NA,NA,NA,-2.39,NA,NA

We understand he has a wonderful opportunity in the private sector, and we wish him nothing but the best in his new endeavor in life.‚Äù She continued, ‚ÄúHe has developed a great leadership team, and we have a very caring and competent staff that will help us through this time of transition. He is highly looked up to by his peers and has been a true, ethical leader during many transitions over the past years.‚Äù Pauly also noted many areas of accomplishment. Several include: ‚ñ™Ô∏èThe remodel and addition of the Jordan Middle School. ‚ñ™Ô∏èThe building of the Jordan Community Education and Recreation Center (CERC) and the joint powers agreement to operate it in conjunction with the City of Jordan. ‚ñ™Ô∏èThe 1:1 Chromebook device program and the flexible learning day model. ‚ñ™Ô∏èCreation of the Jordan Booster Club and the Jordan Education Foundation. ‚ñ™Ô∏èSecuring the donation for the turf field and concession stand. ‚ñ™Ô∏èThe implementation of the Jordan High School Summit Academy. ‚ñ™Ô∏èUnder his leadership, Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT) practices and the American Indian Parent Advisory Council (AIPAC) were implemented. ‚ñ™Ô∏èServed on the Scott Family Net Board providing resources for schools including mental health and chemical dependency resources. ‚ñ™Ô∏èAs a highly respected leader, Mr. Helgerson served as a speaker at the state level at MSBA Conferences, as well as at a national level at the National School Boards Conference.

As you know, the Governor of North Carolina has extended school closure until May 15, 2020. What does school closure mean? It means that the school building, itself, is closed as a learning environment for children. We will no longer be holding regular office hours at our main office. However, as you know and have experienced over the last week and a half, we have been able to develop and deploy our remote learning plan, and this week has been epic! Our teachers and staff have done a phenomenal job switching from a school with four walls to a completely virtual school, and we all want to keep going! So, while the school building will remain closed as a learning environment until May 15th, we are going to continue operating school via remote learning. We will continue to evaluate, revise, and adjust our virtual learning as we begin to introduce new content. Our school calendar remains intact, and we will continue to observe teacher workdays, holidays, breaks, etc. as outlined in our 19-20 calendar. Spring Break will be April 10th-17th, which means that students and teachers will be off. Also, our last day of school for the 2019-2020 school year remains June 5th. As a school, we remain committed to your child‚Äôs growth and education, and we are grateful to continue the school year with your student and family. Thank you for your continued support during this unprecedented time. We know this has been challenging for you. It has been challenging for all of us, but we are excited to partner with you to continue educating and growing your students, preparing them for the future, regardless of the current circumstances. Thank you to all the students and parents that participated in our spirit week activities.

So last spring we changed things up and implemented scheduled, Student Led Conferences (SLC) and our attendance jumped to 72.5%. This year we would like to do even better. Our students should have been talking to you about what the SLC looks like and how they are being scheduled. The SLC provides for the student to prepare for and lead the discussion on their academic progress and allows parents to be involved in school based conversations. Parents will hear from the student about how the new semester is going to this point. What is going well and what challenges they are facing. The SLC format helps students develop the ability to monitor their progress and self-advocacy skills. It is an opportunity for parents to hear their child‚Äôs reflections on their school experience. The SLC is a scheduled time through your child‚Äôs CRT Advisor and many of the time slots are filling up fast. If your son or daughter attends Washburn Tech and does not have a CRT Advisor, you may contact Jayme Doran to schedule an appointment. We know that this format will not be flawless this spring, but we hope that you will give us a chance to continue to develop this new format and provide our students an opportunity for self-reflection and growth. If you have not yet scheduled a SLC and would like to, I encourage you to contact your child‚Äôs CRT Advisor.
