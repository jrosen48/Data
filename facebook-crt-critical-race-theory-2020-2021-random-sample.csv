Astfel, conform noii metodologii, centrele de testare introduc în mod direct rezultatele testelor realizate, urmând ca de la nivelul Direcțiilor de Sănătate Publică să fie realizată ancheta epidemiologică și atribuite cazurile pozitive județului/localității de care aparțin persoanele infectate. Coeficientul infectărilor cumulate la 14 zile, raportate la 1.000 de locuitori este calculat de către Direcțiile de Sănătate Publică, la nivelul Municipiului București și al județelor. Mai jos aveți graficul realizat în baza raportărilor primite de CNCCI de la Direcțiile de Sănătate Publică: Distinct de cazurile nou confirmate, în urma retestării pacienților care erau deja pozitivi, 35 de persoane au fost reconfirmate pozitiv.

Bebe 105361

1Y | M | Stray | 10 lbs.

A volunteer writes: This strapping adolescent boy in a tuxedo will do anything to get your attention. First, it's a chorus of meows. Then, it's poking his paws through the bars, and when he finally captures your attention, he lays down on all fours with his head up high, as if to say, see, see, look at how well-behaved I am. When I started petting him, he was finally calm; he craves abundant human contact. When a staff member visited Bebe, he climbed into her lap and was easy to pick up and return to his kennel. If you are looking for a love like no other, look no further, but look for him as soon as you can; he's as eager as can be.

BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION:

Level 2

BEHAVIOR SUMMARY:

Bebe was at the front, standing tall, alert and curious, and allowed all petting and quickly pushed out to stand and lay on the assessor's lap while watching the nearby cats which caused her to low growl. She was easily picked up and placed back inside the kennel where he remained curious about life outside the kennel. He continued to enjoy all petting with a high tail and when offered catnip rolled in it, and began stretching and rolling on his back left and right. He became even friendlier on the catnip. He has a single bite incident that is not well explained but it's possible he may be prone to over-stimulating and some care should be exercised as he transitions into his new home.

Bebe interacts with the observer, solicits attention, is easy to handle and tolerates all petting. Due to being highly active and with a single bite incident We recommend that he go to a home with some cat experience preferred or at least be well counseled regarding cats who can become (truncated)",NA,NA,NA,-30,NA,2020-11-07T00:00:00Z

Here in California, even Disneyland has not been spared the wrath of the crazies. On May 7, the incomparable Christopher Rufo reported that “The Wokest Place on Earth” now includes employee trainings on systemic racism, white privilege, white fragility, and white saviors, and also launched racially segregated “affinity groups” at the company’s headquarters. But just five days later, Rufo disclosed that Disney “has removed its entire antiracism program from the company’s internal portal, effectively scrubbing it out of existence.” Rufo added, “This is a major victory in the war against ‘woke capital,’” and noted that a “significant backlash from the public” was responsible for the shift. While some skeptics suggested that the policy was being “tweaked or rebranded, not scrubbed,” Rufo responded, “Possibly, but small victories start to add up. We’ve set the precedent—and forced a $329 billion company to back down.” https://sws.sh/Hp2Dd:=:https://tennesseestar.com/2021/06/03/commentary-critical-race-theory-has-radically-transformed-americas-corporations-and-public-schools/?utm_campaign=socialwebsuite&utm_source=socialwebsuite.com&utm_medium=social",https://sws.sh/Hp2Dd,https://tennesseestar.com/2021/06/03/commentary-critical-race-theory-has-radically-transformed-americas-corporations-and-public-schools/?utm_campaign=socialwebsuite&utm_source=socialwebsuite.com&utm_medium=social,NA,Commentary: Critical Race Theory Has Radically Transformed America's Corporations and Public Schools - Tennessee Star,"Just four weeks ago, I wrote about the rising resistance to the woke craze and critical race theory, and much has transpired since then.",NA,NA,NA,-12.29,The Tennessee Star,2021-06-03T00:00:00Z

Certes, vous avez fait l'intégration de ces enseignants communautaires un véritable business aujourd'hui, vous voulez procéder à leurs remplacement comme s'ils n'ont aucune valeur , chose que nous Syndicat National des Enseignants Fonctionnaires des Collectivités Territoriales ( SYNEFCT) n'accepterons jamais.

Lisez bien les faits et comprenez que l'équipe de notre camarade Salam Kassim Ouedraogo a bien mené des enquêtes et des recherches sur la présence et la ponctuation des enseignants contractuels communautaires concernés.

La Subdivision SYNEFCT du CAP de BAGUINEDA a été saisie par leurs camarades Enseignants contratuels communautaires de la commune rurale de TIELE par rapport à un cas de remplacement d'un enseignant contratuel communautaire par un autre suivant la note de service N°007 du 06 juin 2021 du CAP de BAGUINEDA . Le syndicat a entrepris des démarches au près du CAP, il y'a eu une rencontre entre le SYNEFCT avec le CAP, la mairie de Tiélé , le CGS ( Comité de Gestion Scolaire) de Gouani ( Tiélé ) , il a ensuite effectué une mission dans la commune de Tiélé .

Il a été constaté que la subvention de Demba  BAGAYOKO est donnée à certain Lassina DIARRA . Ce même Demba BAGAYOKO avait remplacé un certain Sidi Bocar TOURÉ appelé à  d'autre fonction suivant la note de service 007/CRT de la mairie de Tiélé relative à l'engagement de Demba BAGAYOKO.

Il estime qu'il y'a une complicité entre le CAP, la mairie de Tiélé et le régisseur de l'Académie d'Enseignement de Kati .

Le CAP, méprisant les réalités du terrain a pris une note de service pour remplacer Demba BAGAYOKO à Lassina BAGAYOKO en avançant des raisons non fondées.

Le régisseur de la mairie pour sa part a refusé de mettre en application la note du maire , pire encore, il a inséré le nom de Lassina DIARRA sur les états de paiement sans aucune base juridique.

Le billeteur de l'Académie d'Enseignement de Kati , quant à lui a refusé catégoriquement de mettre le nom de Demba BAGAYOKO sur les états de paiement malgré qu'il ait reçu la note de service du maire .

Pour le moment, la Subdivision SYNEFCT du CAP de BAGUINEDA souhaite que les acteurs concernés par cette question se trouvent sur une même table pour en discuter profondément afin d'éviter toute hypothèse de perturbation de l'année en cours.

Le Sous-préfet ainsi que le CAP de BAGUINEDA ont été saisis déjà par la Subdivision SYNEFCT et des actions fortes verront le jour si une solution définitive n'est pas trouvée à cette situation .

Tous les documents sont à la clé et on est disposé à répondre à toutes les questions qui concernent cette affaire.",NA,NA,NA,-0.78,NA,2021-06-23T00:00:00Z

擇最近而非最熟悉醫院搶救

星洲日報〈醫識力〉記者：梁盈秀筆錄：

心臟病除了是“沉默的殺手”，也是我國首要的死亡殺手。根據2018年的數據，16%國人死於心臟病，也就是說在100宗死亡案例中，有16人死於心臟病，且還有上升的趨勢。

-----------------------------------------
鄭志賢醫生
介入性心臟內科顧問

“任何與心臟相關的疾病都可以叫作心臟病（heart disease），而最常見的冠心病（coronary heart disease）或心臟血管阻塞，是最普通且最普遍的心臟疾病。其他的還包括心律失常、血壓型心臟病、瓣膜性心臟病、心肌病等。

一般人所謂的心臟病發作（heart attack）就是屬於其中一種冠心病。冠心病全名冠狀動脈粥樣硬化（atherosclerosis）性心臟病，是一種因粥樣斑塊沉積在血管壁並造成冠狀動脈（供血給心臟的血管）狹窄的疾病。

當病情進一步擴大，粥狀斑塊破裂潰瘍，進一步形成血栓並堵住動脈，造成心肌細胞因缺血而坏死，就會造成心肌梗塞，即所謂的心臟病發作，患者會覺得胸口悶、走路時氣喘、頭暈甚至暈倒、冒冷汗和心絞痛等。

如果這時他們去醫院掛診，我們可以幫患者做一系列的檢查包括跑步機、電腦斷層掃描（CT scan）還有血管攝影（angiogram）等。

從風險因子評估得病率
--------------------------------
那如何評估一個人是否為冠心病高危群呢？那我們就要從風險因子中求答案了。要知道風險因子愈多，得冠心病的幾率也愈高，當中包括可改變和無法改變的因子。

有些人因為家庭遺傳而成高危群，這是無法改變的因子。另外男性患冠心病的幾率會比女性高，因為女性有荷爾蒙的保護。年長者得冠心病的幾率會比年輕人高，因為年長者的‘機器’用久了，偶爾會有‘垃圾’阻塞。這都是無法改變的。

可以改變的風險因子就是你來找醫生，經由治療及干預，幫你把患上冠心病的風險減到最低，但不能保證你不會患上冠心病。

最常見的可以改變的風險因子包括三高（高血糖、高血脂和高血壓）、抽煙和壓力等。如果你有三高的話，醫生就會開藥給你吃，讓你的三高指數降到一個安全水平，這樣你的風險指數也會跟着降低。其實，不抽煙及多運動是最好的方法，但這要靠你自己。

如何得知一個人心臟病發作呢？其實是有一個通用的心臟病發作信號（universal signs of heart attack） ，就是會突然用手壓住自己的胸口，一般而言，通常會做這個動作的話，大多數是心臟病發作了，那就要趕快送患者去醫院，不要送往熟悉的醫院，而是最靠近的醫院。

根據馬來西亞的統計，在過去10年裡，心臟病的死亡率逐年增高，除了是“沉默的殺手”，也是我國首要的死亡殺手。根據2018年的數據，16%國人死於心臟病，也就是說在每100宗死亡案例中，有16人死於心臟病，此狀況還有上升的趨勢。”

儘早“通波仔”免心肌坏死
-------------------------------------------
“有冠心病的患者，可以儘早做經皮冠狀動脈介入治療（Percutaneous Coronary Intervention，PCI），或俗稱的‘通波仔’，越早做越好，因為如果太遲做，會造成心肌死亡，所以每一分鐘都很重要。

若冠狀動脈阻塞置之不理，心臟功能進一步跌至低於40%時，就會轉變成心臟衰竭，這時醫生只能先以藥物治療。

如果心臟衰竭沒有起色，醫生還是可以處方其他治療，例如選擇心臟再同步化治療（CRT），後者可分為CRT起搏器（CRT-P）及CRT除顫器（CRT-D ）。
CRT-P是一種特殊的起搏器，也被稱為‘雙心室起搏器’；CRT-D也是相同的設備，但它也包括一個內置的心臟復律除顫器（Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators，ICD）。

呼吸困難 疲憊水腫
-----------------------------
一般上心臟疾病是一個接一個而導致的，舉例說，一個患者有高血脂、高血壓和糖尿病，那這個患者的血管一定會阻塞，如果心血管阻塞了，就會導致心臟
病及心肌坏死，按長期來說，就會造成心臟衰竭。

心臟衰竭症狀通常包含呼吸困難、過度疲憊與下肢水腫，特別在運動、平躺與夜間睡眠時容易加劇呼吸急促症狀。

患者在行動與運動時的可負荷量也受到限制，即便控制得宜，運動量依然受限。

……………………

50%送院不及喪命
--------------------------
請勿拿心臟病發作來開玩笑，因為大概有50%的患者是來不及送院搶救而死亡，而另外50%可能來得及送院搶救，但存活率只有30%。

要預防患上心臟病，最好每年定期檢查，心臟的檢查可以包括心電圖（ECG）、心臟超聲波（echocardiography）和心臟壓力測試（cardiac stress test）等。

用一輛車子來比喻，你的車子至少每年都送去保養幾次，為什麼你自己的心臟卻不肯每年保養（檢查）一次呢？如果你不做檢查、不驗血，你根本不知道你的身體有何毛病。

………………

知道自己體力極限 別死撐
-------------------------------------
心臟血管是很細小的，最大也不會超過5毫米，所以很容易阻塞，所以我一再強調，如果有可控制的風險因子，就應該着手干預，例如找醫生去治療共病如糖尿病或高膽固醇，還有不要喝酒抽煙，多做一些可強化心臟功能的有氧運動包括跑步、游泳等。

但是運動歸運動，也不可太過過激烈，好像一些人喜歡跑馬拉松，跑步者一直告訴自己還有最後一公里，告訴自己要撐下去，結果就撐不下去了，所以要知道自己的極限是很重要的，當你覺得太累還是撐不下去時，千萬不可以勉強。

很多人以為心臟病是長者的疾病，其實現在已經年輕化了，我有一個病人才27歲就心臟病發作，沒有任何疾病，除了抽煙之外。

年齡已經不再是心臟病的危險因子，由於現代人的飲食趨向油膩多鹽多糖，再加上喝酒抽煙，因此這些不健康的生活方式，也是造成心臟病年輕化的原因之一。”",NA,NA,NA,-100,新加坡 吹水站,2020-09-15T00:00:00Z

Garland's announcement did not mention a specific topic that the alleged threats were stemming from. Right-rated outlets and voices have paid much more attention to the issue than left- and center-rated sources.

All the patriots were successful in the special session in reaching out to the legislators, and we have their (the legislators) buy in to go against this. The ONLY way we can stop this is through Governor Cox. We have 48 HOURS TOTAL to get enough people to reach out to him! Otherwise, this is permanently in schools beginning 5/20 in pre K-12 through college!

Un capocomico, due aiutanti e un musicista accompagnano il pubblico dentro la tragica ma avventurosa storia del principe di Danimarca

Un viaggio indietro nel tempo per indagare gli intrighi che si celano dietro ad uno dei più grandi classici teatrali di tutti i tempi. Riscoprire Amleto e i suoi dubbi esistenziali per domandarsi quali conseguenze si nascondano – oggi come ieri – dietro alla “non azione” e quanto essa possa paradossalmente finire per essere la più pericolosa delle azioni. Un capocomico, due aiutanti e un musicista accompagnano il pubblico dentro la tragica ma avventurosa storia del principe di Danimarca, una storia fatta di dubbi, morte, tradimenti, amore, vendetta, fantasmi, follia, sogni, utopie e soprattutto di tanto teatro.

While gender fluidity was not raised during the hearing, court documents confirm the male suspect was wearing a skirt when the assault took place, reports Yahoo! News, adding that the female victim testified in court that she was violently coerced into performing sexual acts.

The male student, a 14-year-old boy, was later arrested in connection to the case on two counts of forcible sodomy, the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office said, according to a report by WUSA9.

The teen suspect was found guilty on all charges, reports WJLA 7News I-Team. Sentencing for the student will happen in November, but only after a Loudon County Judge determines the outcome of the second set of charges against the same student involving sexual battery at Broad Run High School.

After the assault at Stone Bridge High School, the male student was transferred to Broad Run, where he allegedly assaulted a second female student in early October.

The victim’s family attorney, Bill Stanley of The Stanley Law Group, released a statement on behalf of the family on Monday, stating, “We are relieved that justice was served today for the Smith’s daughter.”

“This horrible incident has deeply affected the Smith family, and they are grateful for today’s outcome,” the statement added.

Around the time of the sexual assault in the girls’ bathroom, the Loudoun County School Board was concerning itself with a policy that would give students who believe they are the opposite sex access to school facilities, groups, and sports teams of their biological counterparts.

In June, Scott Smith, the father of the victim, went to a Loudoun County school board meeting looking for answers after his daughter was assaulted. A heated exchange ensued at the meeting, and Smith was arrested for obstruction of justice and disorderly conduct.

Hundreds of parents were also present to voice their concerns about the district’s transgender policy and Critical Race Theory (CRT). The school board eventually voted 7-2 to approve the transgender-related policy.

Earlier this month, Scott Ziegler, the superintendent of the embattled Loudoun County Public Schools, admitted that the school district “failed” to provide a safe environment for its students.

Ziegler’s comments were in response to local parents outraged over how reports of the two sexual assaults were handled inside schools. Following the superintendent’s statement, board member Beth Barts — who previously targeted parents who are against Critical Race Theory in schools — resigned from her position.",NA,NA,NA,-9,NA,2021-10-27T00:00:00Z

This handsome Prince needs an ortho consult for hind limb lameness :( A volunteer writes: Within a few minutes of meeting Prince, it was obvious I was in the presence of royalty! He is quick to do his “business” then it is straight to the serious task of getting attention!  He rubs himself against my legs like a cat letting me know he’s ready for some pets.  His body turns into an accordion as I scratch up and down his spine seeming to squeeze his frame together then stretch like elastic in delight, smiling ear to ear while I play music on his back.  During our walk, I notice he has a funny, yet endearing gait to him, his back legs bowing out- possibly requiring some follow up medical care, but adorable nonetheless.

Look at Prince's expression of amazement in his photo. Is he envisioning a new home? He surely is heartbroken over losing his prior one, to which he did nothing wrong to deserve being discarded. He knows the value of a home, and truly cherished his. Prince's prior owner left him with impressive notes. Prince is very well behaved in a home, respectful, does well with dogs, and is still a puppy at heart with his toys. He wears a spicy pumpkin coat, and has a classically handsome face with fluttery ears. He is being faulted for reacting with sadness at being turned over to the shelter, obviously emotions aren't allowed. He arrived with lameness in a hind leg and had a cuticle removed, surely he feels this is the beginning of the end. His smile reveals a true heart and zest for life, therefore we know Prince is so deserving of a chance to live out the rest of his life.

Aug. 20th, 2019 marked the 400th year Anniversary of the ""20 and odd Africans"" who came into Point Comfort on Aug. 20th, 1619 in what would later be called the colony of Virginia. This year was known as ""The Year Of Return"" as many African Americans are reconnecting to Africa and traveling to Ghana and other West African countries. When we discuss the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade we have to first understand that African people are the Original people of North, Central & South America & have been in the land we call U.S. at least 51,700 years. We can’t start studying our history in SLAVERY. Even when we study the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, which is important to study, we can’t start in 1619 or in the 1440s when the Portuguese get involved. We have to understand the history chronologically and deal with the 800 year occupation of Europe by the Africans known as the Moors who enter into the Iberian Peninsula, today known as Spain and Portugal, from North Africa in 711A.D. This course not only deals with the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade but thousands of years of history that leads up to the Slave Trade of African people taking place. #Juneteenth #CriticalRaceTheory #1619Project #TheAHNShow #BlackPodcasters #BlackPodcasts",NA,NA,NA,-16,"Comedy Only...""Say What U Like"" have fun it's only comedy",2021-08-09T00:00:00Z

I’ve just been tagged into a post by Sharon Hargreaves on Canal Market Place who has just had a similar request from Chorley/Wigan council I have been quietly working on this issue so thought I’d better update you as to where we’ve got to I went through the full council complaint procedure, which is lengthy, and then took it to the government ombudsman. They rejected my complaint on the grounds that the council had been operating lawfully, the laws they are referring to are: Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 and The Highway Act 1980 So at this point I’d reached a dead end, until Nevil Ingram contacted me, he sometimes trades with his stall The Big Cheese alongside the trading boats Sweet Barge and Shineonthewater, and is also a small business consultant. Nevil has consulted a City and a County Council, which are on the K & A stated they would not consider enforcing street trading licences, although another unitary authority on the K & A has tried to do so several years ago. The County Council has commissioned a legal opinion on canal trading which tells them that the traders on the towpath should not need street traders licences and that is their policy. So there are different approaches in different places and confusion about what the laws taken as a whole actually say. We feel that there is a need for protection for traders from licencing officers who are acting in this way. We have consulted with a licencing solicitor in Manchester and a barrister experienced in licencing that he works closely with. We have had a zoom meeting together, currently all for free on the basis of Nevil’s friendship and connections, so we’ve had an hour of free advice from a barrister and solicitor, this is what we discussed: Unfortunately, we have been advised/concluded that it is lawful/not unlawful for a licencing officer to require a boat to have street trader licence, although it is manifestly unreasonable – we would say preposterous to consider a towpath a street, and that we have a good case given that we pay a trading levy to CRT and there is trading history on the canals We are proposing two approaches here – short term and long term. Short term is to get a legal opinion written by both a licencing solicitor and a barrister to show how requiring a street traders licence is not backed up in law, which could be shown to any licencing officer who tries this. We believe that in most instances that would stop zealous licencing officers, who would need to go back and consult their in house solicitors, who would see the conflicts in the laws. We are progressing towards that and need to consult with a couple more organisations before publicising the issue and moving to a fund raiser to pay for that work . We are looking at a strategy of the trader refusing to stop trading and forcing the council to take them to court, and then vigorously defending the right to trade. In the longer term we aim to get the law changed to specifically exclude canal traders from needing a street traders licence. We want to move this forward in a collaborative and united way, constructive feedback welcomed We should be in a position to publicise more concrete information within a few days and will keep you all up to date.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-2.08,London Boaters - We Are These People,2021-02-22T00:00:00Z

Lucas just wants to be a good boy, his fear is just overwhelming him!
 
Just reading the notes it is clear that Lucas is completely terrified at the shelter.  He is not a bad dog, the notes do not say he is reacting with any aggression.  He is frozen in fear.  Just read - Lucas is very tense. When any attempt is made to touch him, he freezes. 1/16: Lucas is fearful of handlers and does not allow handling or collaring. He is introduced to the helper dog on a slip lead and appears soft, friendly, and interested.  So please help this guy get out of the shelter, into a home again, where he can relax and learn to be part of a family again.  Help Lucas find love again!

Owner Surrender Reason:
Shelter Assessment Rating: NEW HOPE ONLY
No children (under 13)
Medical Behavior Rating:

CAME IN WITH another dog from the home
 
BEHAVIOR NOTES
Means of surrender (length of time in previous home):
Owner Surrender
 
SAFER ASSESSMENT: Date of assessment: 19-Jan-2020
Summary:
In the assessment room, Lucas is very tense. When any attempt is made to touch him, he freezes. For this reason and out of concern for his stress levels, he is not a good candidate for a handling assessment at this time.

PLAYGROUP NOTES - DOG TO DOG SUMMARIES:
1/16: Lucas is fearful of handlers and does not allow handling or collaring. He is introduced to the helper dog on a slip lead and appears soft, friendly, and interested.

FUN FACTS:

INTAKE BEHAVIOR: Date of intake: 15-Jan-2020
Summary: Growling at the other dog from the home

MEDICAL BEHAVIOR: Date of initial: 16-Jan-2020
Summary: Tense, tail tucked, trembles

ENERGY LEVEL:
We have no history on Lucas so we cannot be certain of his behavior in a home environment. However, he is a young dog who will need daily mental and physical activity to keep him engaged and exercised. We recommend long-lasting chews, food puzzles, and hide-and-seek games, in additional to physical exercise, to positively direct his energy and enthusiasm.

BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION: New Hope Only
Behavior Asilomar TM - Treatable-Manageable

Recommendations:
No children (under 13)

Place with a New Hope partner
Recommendations comments:

No children: Due to how uncomfortable Lucas is currently with touch and novel stimuli, we feel that an adult-only home would be most beneficial at this time.

Place with a New Hope partner: Lucas has not acclimated well to the kennel environment and is uncomfortable with touch, freezing when touched. We recommend placement with a New Hope partner who can provide any necessary behavior modification (force-free, positive reinforcement-based) and re-evaluate behavior in a stable home environment before placement into a permanent home.

Potential challenges:

Handling/touch sensitivity
Fearful

Potential challenges comments:

Handling/touch sensitivity: Lucas is highly uncomfortable with touch at the care center, freezing when any handling is done. He will need a very slow approach and to have touch paired with good things. Please see handout on Handling Sensitivity.
Fearful: Lucas is highly fearful at the care center, darting away from things he passes by. He will need a slow approach and time to acclimate to unfamiliar surroundings. Please see handout on Decompression Period.

PLEASE CONSIDER SAVING THE LIFE of a NYC ACC Death Row cat with your immediate offer to adopt.

TO GET STARTED IMMEDIATELY SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE TO THIS PAGE (click ""Send Message"" from our home page). We will respond asap. You will be directed to complete an app with a registered 501(c)3 New Hope Rescue Partner, who is approved to pull cats from the NYC ACC (shelter). We will immediately alert the rescue of your incoming app.

ABOUT TRANSPORT: In most cases there is FREE TRANSPORT to your area up to a 4 hr. radius outside of NYC, including all or part of NY, NJ, CT, PA, NH, VT, RI, MA, MD, DE & DC (see the transport map provided). More distant adopters can meet the transport van, (i.e. a NC or VA adopter could meet in MD or DC, or an OH adopter could meet in PA).

ABOUT KITTENS: Kittens under 8 wks old & 2 lbs in weight are NOT PUBLICLY ADOPTABLE, due to their fragility. They can only be pulled by a rescue for specially-trained pre-approved kitten foster homes in NY, NJ & CT. Kittens over 8 weeks and 2lbs should preferably go in PAIRS.

ABOUT PLEDGES: Pledges are directly paid to the 501(c)3 NEW HOPE RESCUE PARTNER that pulls the the cat. Pledges do not guarantee a cat's life will be spared but may help a rescue org decide if they can afford to pull the cat and cover his/her vet expenses.

ABOUT US : MLC is 100% volunteer run page. We can help facilitate a rescue, by connecting you with an approved RESCUE group. We are not affiliated with the NYC ACC.",NA,NA,NA,-0.65,Save The Cats 🐾 Because Every Cat Matters,2021-03-25T00:00:00Z

These books about the facts of the history of the melanin people eviscerate the false memories conditioned in our subconscious minds in history class and by the various mechanisms active in the mainstream social culture as a whole. The author of The Negro Question book series is Lee Cummings, and he is one of the greatest melanin historians ever. 2) You should also learn hostage negotiation, de-escalation, and tactical empathy from the perspective of Chris Voss (watch his videos on youtube.com and get his book). The hysteria of critical race theory has the construct of the fact as a hostage; therefore, you need to know how to control the emotional intelligence of the hostage taker. Thus, you can free the facts from being held hostage. Approaching the people spreading the hysteria of critical race theory from a logical perspective will not work. You need to tap into their emotional intelligence to walk them down and bring them back into reality. 3) If you cannot bring them back into reality, then after you read The Negro Question, Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5, Part 6, and Part 7 (specifically Part 6 and Part 7 have major destructive properties on sight against his-story), you simply hit them with facts, facts upon facts upon facts upon facts.",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=545754843497577&set=gm.4390447117653748&type=3,NA,NA,Photos from Cpc Law's post,NA,NA,NA,NA,-0.82,The Re-Education of the American Black Man/Woman,2021-06-25T00:00:00Z

L-am pus de atras atenția, fiindcă, uitați ce ne stă pe inimi:

UNU -- De azi, închidem la ora 18, fiindcă noi așa suntem, litera legii în cuget și-n simțiri.
DOI -- Ne-am bucura dacă înalți demnitari care ne hotărăsc viețile în funcție de incidența infectării n-ar mai pronunța «ingidență». Ne face să ne rușinăm de noi înșine, proști și prostiți. 
TREI -- Ne-am simți demni și văzuți, cum ne tot zdrobim să fim, dacă administrația publică ar preciza explicit numele meseriei noastre și al trebii pe care-o facem, în regulile pe care le-ntocmește. De exemplu: „Cabinetele de medicină veterinară închid la/ deschid până/ stau/ merg.” Altfel, ne scoatem ochii noi între noi, medicii #veterinari, care ce a auzit, cum înțelege, ce traduce. Unu’ ar închide că oricum e obosit, altu’ ar ține deschis, că altfel nu poate trăi. El și familia lui, astăz’ și mâine. Nu e un moment bun să se dușmănească oamenii, oameni buni! 
PATRU -- Miez arată cum ne simțim noi. Dar o să fie bine pentru toată lumea. Vedeți, deja l-am tuns cu breton, după ce l-am cusut, l-am dat cu alifii, i-am făcut toate injecțiile din lume plus una și așa o să se facă el ăl mai frumos băiat, din gunoiul aruncat în… Parcul Central din Cluj, acum două săptămâni.

***Have you lost your mind.....Mark Milley***
# **Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley Compared Trump to Hitler, His Supporters to Brownshirts: New Book**

In the wake of the 2020 election, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley apparently feared President Trump would attempt a coup and compared President Donald Trump and his supporters to Adolf Hitler and Nazi brownshirts, according to a new book. 

Written by The Washington Post's Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, I Alone Can Fix It purports to shine new light on how General Milley and other military brass feared and prepared for a showdown with their commander in chief.  

General Milley ""was so shaken that then-President Donald Trump and his allies might attempt a coup or take other dangerous or illegal measures after the November election that Milley and other top officials informally planned for different ways to stop Trump,"" according to excerpts of the book obtained by CNN.

Milley felt obligated to be ""on guard"" for a potential coup attempt after Election Day, and reportedly said ""they may try, but they're not going to f**king succeed."" 

""Milley told his staff that he believed Trump was stoking unrest,"" claims the book, ""possibly in hopes of an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act and call out the military.""

""You can't do this without the military"" the book says Milley told his deputies. ""You can't do this without the CIA and the FBI"" because ""we're the guys with the guns.""

The book also says Milley saw President Trump as ""the classic authoritarian leader with nothing to lose,"" calling the situation ""a Reichstag moment"" and ""gospel of the Führer."" Milley viewed the pro-Trump Million MAGA March as ""the modern American equivalent of 'brownshirts in the streets.'""

CNN's report quotes a Department of Defense staffer close to Milley as responding to the forthcoming book's claims by saying Milley ""tried his hardest to actively stay out of politics.""

Donald Trump reacted to the book's claims about General Milley with a statement saying he ""never threatened, or spoke about, to anyone, a coup of our government,"" calling the idea ""so ridiculous."" ""If I was going to do a coup,"" Trump explained, ""one of the last people I would want to do it with is General Mark Milley."" 

""Never during my Administration did Milley display what he is showing now. He was not 'woke,'"" Trump continued. ""Actually I don't believe he ever was, but the way I look at Milley, he's just a better politician than a general, trying to curry favor with the Radical Left and the absolute crazy people espousing a philosophy which will destroy our country!""

As Townhall reported last month, General Milley made himself into a defender of the Left's divisive Critical Race Theory in a congressional hearing during which he said ""I want to understand 'white rage,'"" adding he finds it ""offensive that we are accusing the United States military, our general officers, our commissioned, non-commissioned officers of being 'woke.'""

MAXIE THE LAP PUP <3 Maxie will capture your heart with his beautiful face and sweet disposition. A family pet through and through. Heartbreaking to learn he managed to break free from the transport crate in attempt to return to his loved ones. Upon arrival at the shelter Maxie was hesitant, naturally frightened and missing his family dearly while facing the unknown. You can see his worried expression and sad eyes in his photos. He has quickly opened up and showing the fun loving, friendly and affectionate youngster he is. During his assessment he was soft bodied, approached when summoned, and displayed no reactivity to people or dogs, accepted all handling, and agreeable to all assessment tasks. His prior home reported he can guard resources around the children, which reading between the lines means he was taunted the way children can and do play with pets. Maxie does not have a bite history, is young, healthy and oh so handsome! He was surrendered due to no fault of his own, and therefore deserves a forever home. He is a soft heart-ed boy always seeking attention, affection and praise. He is certainly a keeper! If you are interested in giving this solid sweetheart a chance through fostering or adopting, please message us. The shelter doesn't extend time to the doggies, including the awesome ones like Maxie.

A volunteer writes: This is one big sweet boy. He hung around me most of our time out in the backyard. Maxie likes to have the front half of his body on your lap (that's about 35 pounds), but who's complaining. He's a gentle soul and a bit of a big baby. Your heart will melt when he looks at you with those big brown eyes

She comes complete with memorable bunny ears, an open and honest smile and a heart of gold. Mika is super enthusiastic and fun loving.

MIKA@MANHATTAN ACC
Mika ID#112679, 3 years old, 56 lbs
Large Mixed Breed, BLACK/WHITE spayed female 
Came into shelter as a STRAY 
Medical Behavior:
Behavior Assessment Rating: LEVEL 3
INTAKE DATE: 3/4/2021

PET PROFILE:
My health has been checked.
My vaccinations are up to date.
My worming is up to date.
I have been microchipped.

We have no history on Mika so we do not have any information regarding her history or behavior in a home setting. At the care centers Mika has been noted to appear highly social with handlers and has been very food motivated. Mika has been observed to leash bite with great intensity, jumping up to grab the leash repeatedly and thrashing with the leash in her mouth. Mika has also been observed to be dog reactive, running toward dogs with a tense body and hard barking. Due to the intensity of leash biting Mika is a safety concern to house in a shelter setting.

WHAT MY FRIENDS AT ACC SAY ABOUT ME:

My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet!

I have been known to shower my favorite people in love!

I would do best in a home with only adult humans.

I am playful and cute!

I am not one to sit still! I will flourish in a home with someone that will keep me mentally and physically active!

Not only do I pull at heart strings, but I also pull on leash! I will need someone to help me with my leash manners.

I am also inspired by two teachers. Dr. Bernard J. Cigrand who on June 14, 1885 put the American Flag on his desk and had his students write an essay in observance of ‘Flag Birthday’. Four years later, a New York City kindergarten teacher, George Balch, planned Flag ceremonies in his school. This led to ‘Flag Day’ being observed by the New York State Board of Education. 

Our flag must always remain a symbol of what unites Americans of all backgrounds. We must not let the forces at work in our schools, including right here in Westchester, divide us by indoctrinating our next generation of children by teaching them the destructive and divisive Critical Race Theory. 

This indoctrination sadly seeks to deprive us all of the promise of our shared American values, liberties and freedoms - all of which are endowed by God and not by government. 

Let’s all recommit, especially those who run our institutions of learning and those who have taken up the vocation of teaching, to teach our kids to love our flag, to teach our kids to love our nation and to teach our kids to love all of our fellow Americans. Then we can truly safeguard all future generations so America lives up to the promise of our ideals and remains a beacon of hope for all; symbolized by our magnificent American Flag!",NA,NA,NA,-0.5,Somers Republican Town Committee,2021-06-14T00:00:00Z

TO BE KILLED 

**$250 DONATION**

A private donor has graciously offered to pay $250 to the New Hope partner that pulls Simba 123557. The shelter does not assume any responsibility for payment, nor does it warranty payment by this donor or any donor to you.

Lived in a crate for most of his life, 2 year old Simba is completely at a loss as to what life is all about.  His rescuer then dumped him quickly at a police station where because of an incident, the ACC is portraying him like a bad dog.  He is a scared pup at the ACC, and we can conclude that he was also freaked out at the precinct.  He refused the food offered to him, so the officer took the food and walked away, then Simba bit the policeman’s pant leg.  The temp adopter said there’s no resource guarding seen in Simba, so what is it?  Scared animals think that humans are out to hurt or do something bad to them.  Imagine an injured cat , how angry and suspicious  he must be, and to approach him is foolish.  Dogs behave the same way when they are badly scared, they are on guard to defend themselves. That’s nature. Simba thought the policeman was a threat, he was suspicious and scared, didn’t accept the food, and lashed out when he thought he had the opportunity.  The notes said no provocation, which we humbly say there probably was, but might be perceptible only to the experienced dog person. The crucial point is Simba has not had good experiences with humans.  His adopter said he is a happy excitable puppy, which no one has seen up to this point.  This young boy has not had a life of comfort. In fact his life from the beginning, living in a crate, then 1 week of happiness at home with his adopter,  then betrayal by this very person.  Dumped at the police station and then dumped at the ACC.  From the four small walls of his crate, Simba most probably never imagined that his brief taste of freedom and “love” would end this way.  Dogs like Simba need our compassion and understanding, he needs us to help him find the miracle that he needs to get out alive.  We ask you, please help however you can, help this poor puppy who is most likely just over a year old.  He needs a committed experienced home with no children, because he is so scared at the ACC.   Please help Simba  have the life he deserves. 

Simba is fearful & needs an experienced, caring owner and home ASAP.

MEDICAL BEHAVIOR:  
Date of initial: 27-Feb-2020  
Summary:
Loose body, allowed handling
  
ENERGY LEVEL:
We have no history on Jasmine so we cannot be certain of her behavior in a home environment. At the care center, she displays a medium-low level of activity.

BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION: Level 1   
Recommendations: No young children (under 5). Recommendations comments: No young children: Due to the behavior seen in the care center, we feel that Jasmine may be intimidated by young children. She needs a slow approach and time to warm up. She should never be forced to interact with new people, and should be allowed to greet and initiate an interaction at her own pace. Older, gentle children should have an in-depth interaction prior to adoption 
Potential challenges: Fearful. Potential challenges comments: Fearful: Jasmine is fearful at the care center and would benefit from a slow approach. Please see handout on Decompression Period.

The comments and super chats were just really annoying. I wish there was a way to remove spam idiots. However, i felt it was fair and educational especially in how you get to see into the mind of the other side. It could honestly help you to figure out what to expect and how best to prepare to counter their narratives, but the first step is always being open and willing to have the discussion. It’s not about having an echo chamber like the partisans, it’s about having a discussion. That’s the only way to avoid the culture war fully exploding in my mind, and why it probably will explode. I feel tim wasn’t prepared for the points that the guy brought up which left him at a disadvantage. 1. Covid deaths and trump was a huge fight but they shoulda brought up the deaths per million and such and woulda seen that the US is not the worst. Honestly Tim needed someone there to go look for the facts to help argue it. He also shoulda brought up the panic over toilet paper. Plus, the hindsight argument coulda been done better. The CDC and WHO kept flip flopping and nobody knew anything. And there is the need to keep up morale like any good leader knows. Also the stats for the death contributions of the Dem governors woulda come well. The list is extensive but Tim wasn’t prepared to debate. 2. Healthcare honestly never gets looked at properly because socialized medicine is cool if you are looking to treat everyone but not for research and development of those treatments. Plus, Trump and the drug prices and fighting big Pharma woulda been a good point to hammer him with. 3. The schools showed the guy actually supporting school choice in theory but just hating on it cus of his TDS. Tim coulda caught him on that. 4. Critical race theory was just a mess cus the guy didn’t even share the main idea of critical race theory to me. It seemed he had some utopian idea that honestly most of the left wouldn’t agree with. 5. His labeling of the right and left coulda been handled better if Tim had hit hard against him on the Far Left and not let him get off with how the left is diverse but the right is all fascist.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-2.2,NA,2020-10-28T00:00:00Z

This adorable little guy is amazing! Tank was found as a stray out roaming the streets of Mesquite. Weighing in at 2.8 lbs, it is amazing that he survived out there. Luckily, he was turned into Mesquite Animal Shelter by a good Samaritan. When no owner stepped forward to claim him, the team at the Mesquite Animal Shelter reached out to CRT to see if we could bring him into our program and help him to find his forever home. We were happy to help him, Tank has stolen our hearts. Tank is a sweet, lean, cuddling machine. He enjoys other small dogs and has fit right into the pack, even though his foster mates are 2-3 times his size. Tank is not afraid to play with them at all. We are not sure he has looked in the mirror to see how small he is! He definitely holds his own and often is the instigator of play! So far, we have not really seen him playing with toys, but he is curious about them. Tank really loves his human family and wants to be near them all the time. He is super excited to be held, to play or cuddle with them. They have chosen to have him sleep overnight in a large crate because of his size & fear of injuring him in their sleep. Tank does, however, love a nice afternoon nap on the bed with them. Our vet estimates that Tank is about 2-3 years old. He seems to adapt to new situations quickly. Tank weighs about 2.8 pounds, and is slightly underweight. We have him on a high nutrition diet so he can safely gain a little weight. Our vet thinks he should be about 3.5 to 4 pounds at his ideal weight. He will always be a tiny dog. Ideally, we are looking for a family that is experienced with very small dogs for his forever home. Tank loves going outside and exploring the backyard. Note that Tank is small and therefore will always need his human nearby while he is out (there are instances where hawks or large birds will swoop down and pick up small dogs under 5 pounds, so you will want to be there to protect Tank). We also want to emphasize that your fence must be very secure. Tank is so tiny that she can easily slip under the smallest opening in a fence, so he will need to be in a home with a solid, fenced yard (preferably wooden fence). Note that he does like to explore and will definitely check out your fence area. Please be sure that your yard and home are very secure in all aspects. Tank has not been in foster care long, so he is not housebroken yet. He is very smart and will hopefully train easily. We are working with him daily and have already seen improvement in the time he has been with us. Tank’s ideal home would be one with activity and lots of love to share. We think Tank would enjoy another small dog as a buddy, but we also think he would do fine as an only dog as long as his family was around a lot and gave him lots and lots of love. He would be great for a work at home or retired family where he could spend the afternoon on a warm lap. Tank is generally very quiet, but he will probably alert you if he hears someone coming! Due to his tiny size and small frame, he should not be in a home with children. This little guy is so sweet, and we are excited to help him find his forever home.!

FOUND TIED UP BY THE POLICE, precious young Leonidas felt the need to defend and protect himself when he was being examined. This beautiful chocolate boy with expressive eyes obviously didn’t have a good start in his life. Bloody diarrhea, then abandoned tied up, Leonidas’ people most probably had very little regard for him. Yet after being treated the way he was, and under all that fear, Leo has warmed up and has become highly social to staff members he has grown to like. Leonidas has a good heart, waiting for the right human to bring out the best in him. In spite of his initial lunging and barking, Leonidas earned a Level 3 rating because he has shown his good side. Please someone save this boy who just wants to make friends, if only he was given love and kindness early in his life. It’s not too late because Leonidas WANTS TO TRUST ! Please advocate for this poor boy whose life will end soon.

ENERGY LEVEL: We have no history on Leonidas so we cannot be certain of his behavior in a home environment. However, he is a young, enthusiastic dog who will need daily mental and physical activity to keep him engaged and exercised. We recommend long-lasting chews, food puzzles, and hide-and-seek games, in additional to physical exercise, to positively direct his energy and enthusiasm.

BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION: Level 3

Recommendations:
No children (under 13)

Recommendations comments:
No children: Due to the potential for defensive aggression that Leonidas has displayed, along with him being very fearful with unfamiliar people, we recommend an adult only home.

Tonight, protesters in Louisville, Kentucky, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York City, Rochester, and other cities are calling for justice and reminding observers that Black Lives Matter after a grand jury on Wednesday declined to charge the three officers involved in Breonna Taylor’s murder. The grand jury did indict Brett Hankison, one of the officers involved, on charges of first-degree wanton endangerment for shooting into her apartment and that of her neighbors without a clear line of sight. His actions, according to the charge, exhibited “extreme indifference to the value of human life,” Hankison had to post a bond of $15,000. 

On March 13, three plainclothes Louisville police officers broke down the door of Breonna Taylor’s apartment as part of an investigation of a man they believed was a drug dealer in a different part of the city. Taylor had once dated the man, and police say they believed he had used her apartment to receive packages. They broke in without announcing who they were, and when they came through the door, Taylor’s boyfriend, who had a license to carry a gun, thought they were criminals and shot one of them in the leg. The three officers fired off 32 shots, six of which hit Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician. 

She died within minutes.

The officers found no drugs.

After Taylor’s death, the officers involved filled out an incident report that said they had not forced their way into the apartment—witnesses and crime scene photographs show they did—and listed Taylor’s injuries as “none.” 

On September 15, Taylor’s family and the city of Louisville announced they had reached a record-breaking $12 million settlement in the shooting, Louisville’s largest ever for police actions and one of the largest in the nation for the shooting of a Black American by law enforcement officers. The settlement includes a wide range of police reforms. 

But when announcing the criminal charges, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron explained that Hankison’s bullets had not hit Taylor, so he could not be charged in her death. And since her boyfriend had shot at them first, the officers who did kill Taylor were justified in their use of force. It is unlikely there will be other charges, he said. The lawyer for Taylor’s family has called the six-month investigation a cover-up, and has asked Cameron to release the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings.

Democratic Governor Andy Beshear agreed that ""It's time to post all the information…. All the facts, all the interviews, all the evidence, all the ballistics, to truly let people look at the information…. One of the problems we've had over the last six months is a total lack of explanation and information,"" he added. ""And the vacuum that's created there — our emotions, frustrations — can truly fill that. It's time for people ... to be able to come to their own conclusions about justice.""

Cameron, a Republican, cited the pending trial and an FBI investigation as a reason to keep the evidence under wraps. “At this point, I don’t think it’s appropriate” to release more information, he said. 

“I have to say, as an attorney, that the decision didn’t surprise me,” said Savala Trepczynski of the University of California Berkeley School of Law. “It’s very hard to hold the police accountable in a deep way... given the system that’s in place and how it tends to favor police at every turn. As a person, though, the (decision) is upsetting, disappointing, angering — all of those things. I felt grief, a familiar grief.”

The idea that our laws are written in such a way that they privilege white people and disadvantage people of color, especially Black Americans, is the principle at the heart of critical race theory. This is the theory that Trump has called “un-American propaganda,” and which he has ordered federal agencies to stop addressing. 

Trump learned about critical race theory from Tucker Carlson’s show on the Fox News Channel, and that show, too, was in the news today. A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought against Carlson by Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claims to have had an affair with Trump before he became president. In 2018, on his show, Carlson accused McDougal of extorting Trump. She sued him for defamation. 

Lawyer Erin Murphy argued for FNC that Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil, a Trump appointee, should toss the lawsuit because Carlson’s show is not news. It is commentary, Murphy said, and so he has no obligation to tell the truth. Murphy said that a reasonable viewer should recognize that Carlson simply provides hypothetical statements to offer “provocative things that will help me think harder,” and his accusations against McDougal, couched as questions, were simply provocations. ""What we’re talking about here, it’s not the front page of The New York Times,"" Murphy said. “It’s Tucker Carlson (truncated)",NA,NA,NA,-6.67,NA,2020-09-25T00:00:00Z

Dear Tucker Carlson,

Hey Tuck, I just got done watching a segment of your show. You know, the one where you suggest that there should be a camera in every classroom in order to root out…let me get this accurate…”civilization ending poison.” https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1412566208763895810

I’m going to zig where you thought most teachers would zag. I welcome your Orwellian cameras in my classroom. Frankly, I don’t know many teachers who would object to having people watch what we do. As a matter of fact, I hate to tell you this Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson, but most of us spent the last year having video cameras in our classrooms.

See, I think you believe that your suggestion that people see what happens in our classrooms will somehow scare teachers. The truth of it is that we have been begging for years to have people, such as yourself, come into our classrooms. I somewhat famously asked Ms. DeVos to visit a public school before she became Secretary of Education (https://www.huffpost.com/entry/an-introduction-from-public-school-teachers-to-betsy_b_5845e2fbe4b0707e4c8171a3). It’s unclear whether she has yet to set foot in an actual public school classroom, but I digress. I sense that you think you’ll see all of us pinko teachers speaking endlessly about Critical Race Theory leading to…and again, let me get this right, “civilization ending poison.” I’ve been in a lot of classrooms (more than you I am willing to bet) and I think you’re going to be disappointed on that front.

What happens in America’s classrooms is teaching and learning. Your “spy cameras” will see teachers and students working together to be better every day. I’ll tell you what I saw on a tour of classrooms not that long ago. I saw a group of kindergartners trying to create bridges over running water with basic classroom supplies in a lesson about collaboration. I saw a high school literature class talking about the character development in The Glass Menagerie. I saw a middle school history class participating in group project where they had to solve problems in a fictional city, with specifics of how they would utilize resources and build public support for their projects. Anyone watching your cameras will see learning…all day every day.

For those who watch your “nanny cams” carefully, they’ll see a lot of other things as well. They will see teachers working with students who have vastly different life experiences. They will see students who are fluent in multiple languages working with teachers to become proficient in yet one more language. They will see students who are hungry get their one solid meal a day in the cafeteria. They will see students itching for more fine arts, industrial technology, or world languages to be offered in their school. In my classroom, if we’re being honest, they’ll probably hear some sketchy intonation from my saxophones, and I promise we’re working on it. But for sure, they will see learning…all day every day.

To be honest, I’m fascinated by the logistics of your proposal. In a world where school districts are struggling to recruit and maintain teachers, who is going to man your “citizen review boards” (setting aside the fact that public school teachers already answer to publicly elected school boards)? For instance, in my school district I sense you would need well over 500 cameras going every day. Who watches those 500 screens 10 hours a day (I want you watching my 7 am jazz band and my after school lessons)? What qualifications would these “experts” need to know what they were watching for? What happens when they catch a teacher teaching…let me get this right…”civilization ending poison?” Who do they report that to? I’m also curious who will pay for all of this incredible technology. Maybe I missed it, but can you point me to a K-12 institution where Critical Race Theory is being taught? Hell, can you define Critical Race Theory for all of us? I’m sure you’ve got answers to all of these questions.

Frankly, I’ve never been able to figure out, instead of dreaming up Orwellian plans to have Big Brother in all of our classrooms, why you don’t round up an army of bright young conservatives to actually step up and teach? Is it because teachers work hard, aren’t paid as much as those with similar educational backgrounds, don’t have support from our elected officials, constantly serve as punching bags for those who don’t understand public education, or is it just because it’s easier to throw rocks at a house than to build one?

Here’s the real deal Tuck, I grew up with my mom making me eat your family’s Salisbury Steaks once every couple of weeks (his family makes Swanson TV dinners) for many years. I struggle to take advice on teaching and learning from a guy who makes a steak that, on its best day, tastes like shoe leather that has been left out in a goat pasture (truncated)",NA,NA,NA,1.25,Republicans and Democrats United for Biden-Harris,2021-07-17T00:00:00Z

Kenjus Watson, Ph.D. is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Health and Equity Research Lab in the Biology Department at San Francisco State University. Uprooting Cellular Anti-Blackness will enlighten us on mind-blowing research that reveals adverse effects of toxic anti-black racism.  We are invited to reflect deeply on the bio-psycho-social impact of everyday racism, particularly in schooling spaces from kindergarten to college.  We will also engage and share practices that can foster cellular healing and restoration. His research concerns critical race theory, the biopsychosocial impact of everyday racism on Black students, the promises of school abolition and the re-Indigenization of Education.  Kenjus also teaches courses in the Education Department and Black Studies Program at Occidental College. He earned his BA in Psychology at Occidental College, and his Ph.D. in Education with an emphasis in Race and Ethnic Studies at UCLA. See more. Other resources: https://www.apocalypticeducation.org/

A $500 stipend will be offered to the New Hope partner that pulls NEMO.

Please note that in order to qualify for the stipend, the animal cannot go to a boarding facility 

The shelter writes: ""Nemo has vomited 3x so far and has concerning gas distention. We are not sure what the cause is, but it could possibly be ileus, foreign body/obstruction, or volvulus. Nemo needs to leave the shelter by EOD tomorrow, 11/22 and needs to be hospitalized for continued supportive care. He needs an abdominal ultrasound and potential exploratory surgery. Nemo has been nervous so far; however, he did warm up with a slow approach""

250 USD private stipend via DLM for NEMO's medical costs.

INTAKE DATE: 11/16/2020 

He’s special, sweet and loves his treats!  NEMO arrived at the shelter a stray, and though initially shy and timid, with a couple minutes and a few treats his tail quickly started to wag.  It’s understandable that he was scared from having been out wandering the streets of NYC lost and alone, and it takes a guy some time to decompress after such a harrowing adventure to find his playful spirit again.  But Nemo is doing just that, and now he is ready to find his perfect forever family.  He’s a stunning big boy, with a big and gentle heart to match, sure to become someone’s cuddlebug on the sofa and best friend for life.  We’d love to see him ensconced by someone’s holiday tree soon!  So don’t wait!  HURRY AND MESSAGE OUR PAGE or EMAIL US at NYCDogsLivesMatter@gmail.com if you can foster or adopt this darling boy.

A staffmember writes:  “Nemo was brought in by the police. He is apparently healthy. Nemo has been nervous and tense so far; however, he did warm up with a slow approach and treats - he LOVES treats.”

3/2/20: updated at-risk note, added bio and video, and in-shelter observations.

Fortesque
Hello, my name is Fortesque. My animal id is #88843. I am a male brown brindle dog at the Manhattan Animal Care Center. The shelter thinks I am about 3 years 1 weeks old.

I came into the shelter as a agency on 2/19/2020.

Sorry, this pet is for new hope partners only.

Fortesque is at risk for behavioral reasons. Fortesque came to us as a stray after being found tied to a park bench, so not much is known about his past. At the care center, Fortesque has remained fearful and has displayed distant behaviors such as barking and growling, particularly around people he doesn't know. Fortesque has not allowed for some extensive handling, but in time, does allow for leashing and will go out on a walk and is social but will growl and react to strangers. It is possible that in time, Fortesque will become more comfortable, but will need a gradual acclimation and slow introduction to new people and environments. He would be best suited for placement with a new hope partner that can provide the necessary behavior modification. Medically, Fortesque was diagnosed with canine infectious respiratory disease complex which is contagious to other animals and will need further care.

You may know me from such films as...
https://youtu.be/DIgEB4wXdpY

Let's get to know each other a bit more...
A staff member writes ""Fortesque takes his time making new friends but once the key to his heart, food, is found, he will warm up quickly. He needs a special person who will understand that he has a guarded heart and will make friends at his own pace. A quiet home where he will have the space and time to do this would be ideal for him. Once he gets to know his people he will be a loyal friend.""

S’adressant à la nation le 19 août, le colonel-major, porte-parole de la junte, a déclaré sur l’ORTM « Le Mali sombre de jour en jour dans le chaos. L’anarchie et l’insécurité par la faute des hommes chargés de sa destinée…....le clientélisme politique, la gestion familiale des affaires de l’Etat ont fini par tuer toute opportunité de développement dans le peu qui reste encore de ce beau pays. La gabegie, le vol et l’arbitraire sont devenus des vertus… » Dans cette logique, la junte s’était engagée à assurer la sécurité des personnes, de leurs biens et de mettre tout en œuvre pour ramener la paix au centre, au nord du Mali en recouvrant l’intégrité territoriale et l’unité nationale de notre pays. A l’issue des concertations nationales, les forces vives ont adopté la charte de la transition, le 12 septembre 2020, fixant entre autres les prérogatives du Président et du Vice-président et des autres organes de la Transition. Cependant, nous constatons avec surprise que le Vice-président s’occupe plus des questions politiques que celles de défense et de sécurité à lui dédiées par la charte. Après sa mise en place, le gouvernement de transition peine toujours à faire face aux urgences sécuritaires, sociales et politiques, toute chose qui montre son incompétence et son amateurisme à conduire cette transition à une issue heureuse marquée par des élections générales crédibles et apaisées dans le délai convenu de 18 mois. Plus de deux mois après, le Président et le Gouvernement de la Transition du Mali ont servi aux Maliens une gouvernance qui se caractérise comme suit : - la militarisation des postes politiques et administratifs, triste réalité laissant transparaitre leur mépris des urgences du pays au grand dam des populations abandonnées à leur sort de plus en plus sombre aux plans sécuritaire, alimentaire et sanitaire ; - la violation de la Constitution du 25 février 1992 et de la charte de la transition dans la gestion des affaires de l’Etat pour le pilotage à vue est devenue patente à travers la mise en place du CNT de colmatage, de népotisme et de clientélisme ; - le manque de transparence dans la gestion des affaires publiques ; - le glissement inquiétant du Vice-président sur les prérogatives du Président de la Transition, met celui-ci dans un rôle de second plan et cela contrairement à l’esprit et à la lettre du choix souhaité par les maliens d’un civil pour présider la transition ; - l’incapacité des autorités de la Transition à apaiser le front social n’est plus un mystère pour les maliens, eu égard, à l’ébullition de plus en plus préoccupante de celui-ci par des grèves perlées de l’UNTM, du SNESup, du syndicat des collectivités, du syndicat des médecins etc…. ; - la gestion chaotique de la crise COVID 19 et de la situation sanitaire en général en méprisant les revendications légitimes des professionnels de santé ; - le regain de l’insécurité urbaine dans les campagnes, les villes et sur les routes est malheureusement une réalité quotidienne des populations qui en payent le prix fort ; - enfin, les autorités de la transition deviennent de plus en plus illégitimes par leur isolement par manque de consensus des forces sociopolitiques conséquentes du pays pour la gestion des affaires publiques urgentes. Pour toutes ces raisons, Nous, Coalition pour le Redressement de la Transition (CRT) « Anka Faso Tilén » DEMANDONS : - la dissolution du Conseil national de Transition en vue de la mise en place d’un autre CNT plus inclusif sur la base d’une clé de répartition conséquente car alliant représentativité et efficacité des membres devant le composer ; - au Vice-président de la Transition de se consacrer strictement aux questions de défense et de sécurité, rôle qui lui est dévolu par la charte de la transition ; - la démission de tous les militaires des postes politiques pour se consacrer au recouvrement de l’intégrité territoriale du pays ; - l’ouverture incessante d’un dialogue franc avec l’UNTM, le syndicat de la santé et tous les autres syndicats sous le leadership du Président de la Transition ; - la diligence des réformes politiques et institutionnelles indispensables à des élections générales crédibles et apaisées ; - au Président de la Transition de mettre à la disposition de la justice tous les rapports du vérificateur générale des dix dernières années ; - la diligence des autorités dans la délivrance de la carte NINA aux Maliens de l’intérieur et de la diaspora ; - à la communauté internationale de redoubler d’efforts aux côtés de nos FAMAs pour ramener la paix et recouvrir l’intégrité territoriale du Mali ; - au Président de la Transition, de faire sortir le calendrier de la transition sur la base de la Charte en vue de respecter le délai imparti de 18 mois.

To know her is to love her! Only sunny skies with this sweet doll Stormy! She earned the prized level 1 behavior rating and is only too happy to demonstrate why. Stormy does everything with finesse and sincerity. Her honest to goodness heart cannot be beat. Both shelter staff and her prior owner agree upon her excellence. She does nicely with children, dogs and cats. She is well behaved when left alone, seeks attention and affection, soft bodied, shares all resources, allows all handling, and obedient. She lacks nothing except a loving home. She also happens to be easy on the eyes, though she is too pleasantly plump at the moment. If you are interested in this angel, please message our page.

Che cos’è la gravità? No, non stiamo parlando di qualcosa di preoccupante, ma di una forza che attrae i corpi che hanno una massa. Tipo una mela matura che si stacca dall’albero e cade sulla testa di un fisico 🍎.

Così, questa mattina, le alunne e gli alunni della 2A e della 2B della scuola media Frassati, grazie al laboratorio di Infini.To e INFN, hanno iniziato a scoprire il ruolo della #forza di #gravità, che consente di comprendere meglio tutto l’universo.

Il viaggio di Next Land è appena iniziato: quali altre affascinanti scoperte attendono i nostri viaggiatorə?

The next event is on Saturday, September 18, 2021 from 9 to 1 at the Spence Farm property located at 41 Wyman Street in Woburn.  

For the health and safety of all, masks will be required to be worn by both customers and volunteers during the collection. Thank you!

This is an excellent opportunity to recycle these items at a minimal cost, while supporting a local group or organization each month. 

There is a significant cost savings compared to the higher cost associated with curbside appliance recycling programs.  

In Woburn, the cost for curbside pick-up of many of these items has increased once again in 2021.

The drop-off recycling drives at Spence Farm are open to residents and businesses from all communities, not just Woburn. 

With your support, over the years these collections have raised over $200,000 for local non-profit organizations, as well as several thousand dollars in donations to the Woburn Memorial High School Scholarship Fund.  

So, clean out those basements, attics, garages, and warehouses and bring your items to the next drive on Saturday, September 18th. 

Please be aware that if you cannot make this collection, the next one is not until October 16th here at the Spence farm building! 

Please see photo for pricing.

Shy, at first, with people, Ghost then becomes affectionate and friendly once he knows you.  He plays well with other dogs, but feels so lost and scared at the shelter.  THIS IS A GOOD SWEET BOY!  Owner described Ghost as being friendly, affectionate and shy.  He likes to play with balls, and squeaky toys and  fetch, tug, and chase are his favorite ways to spend time.. His favorite treats are bone chew treats. Ghost is just an innocent puppy that has only known the world of his family.  He needs a hero to show him that everything will be ok, that there is happiness to be had and a life to live. So please help Ghost find this!  Please help #SAVEGHOST now!

Sorry, this pet is for new hope partners only.

Ghost was placed at risk due to behavioral concerns; Because Ghost remains highly fearful in the care center and has been observed to escalate quickly to hard barking, growling and snapping at handlers when uncomfortable, we feel as though he would be best set up to succeed if placed with an experienced rescue partner. Ghost is otherwise healthy.

Vaccine mandates for kids?  Cameras and video links in classrooms?  Complete and transparent disclosure of lesson plans, syllabus requirements and curriculum?  Charter schools?  

Those are the questions we want answered and furthermore their reasons for a yea or nay response to accompany the same.

School board positions are THEE most important electoral office coming up, not senator, nor congressperson, nor Mayor, Governor or President.  Don’t let them off the hook with platitudes like, “I’m in this for the kids,” or “I want to make a difference.”  Those are bullshit answers to specific questions.  

Hold their feet to the fire.  Our childrens’ futures depend on it.

Jerry Craft  is a brilliant writer who I have known and worked with for a  number of years. The Katy School District near Houston pulled his book because a parent claimed the book is inappropriate because of critical race theory. SMH

Oggi pomeriggio l’Unità di Crisi della Regione Piemonte ha comunicato che i pazienti virologicamente guariti, cioè risultati negativi ai due test di verifica al termine della malattia, sono diventati 2.136 (276 in più di ieri): 161 (+22) in provincia di Alessandria, 84 (+4) in provincia di Asti, 89 (+1) in provincia di Biella, 228 (+49) in provincia di Cuneo, 159 (+19) in provincia di Novara, 1.152 (+149) in provincia di Torino, 119 (+19) in provincia di Vercelli, 116 (+10) nel Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, 28 (+3) provenienti da altre regioni. Altri 1.594 sono “in via di guarigione”, ossia negativi al primo tampone di verifica dopo la malattia e in attesa dell’esito del secondo. Ore 19.30. I decessi salgono a 2.224. Sono 78 i decessi di persone positive al test del Covid-19 comunicati nel pomeriggio dall’Unità di Crisi della Regione Piemonte, di cui 19 al momento registrati nella giornata di oggi (si ricorda che il dato di aggiornamento cumulativo comunicato giornalmente dall’Unità di crisi può comprendere anche decessi avvenuti nei giorni precedenti e solo successivamente accertati come decessi Covid). Il totale è ora di 2.224 deceduti risultati positivi al virus, così suddivisi su base provinciale: 438 ad Alessandria, 110 ad Asti, 141 a Biella, 158 a Cuneo, 211 a Novara, 918 a Torino, 131 a Vercelli, 93 nel Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, 24 residenti fuori regione ma deceduti in Piemonte. Ore 19.30. Il bollettino dei contagi. Sono 19.954 (+693 complessivi rispetto a ieri, di cui il 64 per cento riscontrati nelle case di riposo) le persone finora risultate positive al Covid-19 in Piemonte. Su base provinciale: 2.718 Alessandria, 964 Asti, 728 Biella, 1.921 Cuneo, 1.890 Novara, 9.543 Torino, 947 Vercelli, 918 Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, 213 residenti fuori regione ma in carico alle strutture sanitarie piemontesi. I restanti 112 casi sono in fase di elaborazione e attribuzione territoriale. I ricoverati in terapia intensiva sono 328 (-17 rispetto a ieri). I ricoverati non in terapia intensiva sono 3.266. Le persone in isolamento domiciliare sono 10.406. I tamponi diagnostici finora eseguiti sono 89.136, di cui 45.812 risultati negativi. Ore 19.15. Pronta l’area sanitaria delle Ogr Torino. E' pronta la nuova area sanitaria all'interno delle Officine grandi riparazioni di Torino, che sarà dedicata a posti di terapia subintensiva e degenza per i pazienti affetti da Covid-19 per un totale di 92 posti letto. Sarà operativa da domenica prossima. I lavori di allestimento, avviati a seguito della sottoscrizione di un'intesa lo scorso 4 aprile tra Regione Piemonte, Prefettura e Comune di Torino, Società consortile per azioni Ogr-Crt e Fondazione Crt, hanno interessato un’area di 8.900 mq. L'utilizzo è stato consentito dalla Fondazione Crt, proprietaria del complesso, mentre la Compagnia di San Paolo ha stanziato 3 milioni per l'allestimento della struttura sanitaria. Ore 18.30. Reclutati oltre 2.000 medici, infermieri e altro personale sanitario. Sono ad oggi complessivamente 2.015 le risorse umane aggiuntive reclutate con diverse forme contrattuali per fronteggiare l’emergenza Coronavirus: 355 medici, 888 infermieri e 772 altre professionalità (personale medico laureato, biologi, farmacisti, operatori socio-sanitari, tecnici di laboratorio e fisioterapisti). “E’ grazie alla disponibilità e alla generosità dei tanti operatori che si sono messi a disposizione - osserva l’assessore alla Sanità, Luigi Genesio Icardi - che siamo riusciti a mettere il nostro sistema sanitario in grado di fare fronte all’emergenza, potenziando sia gli ospedali sia il sistema del territorio, senza contare l’avviamento di nuove strutture dedicate appositamente ai pazienti Covid, come l’ospedale di Verduno e l’area sanitaria temporanea delle Ogr di Torino, operativa da domenica prossima”. Ore 15. Oltre 7 milioni per sostenere autonomi e imprese. Saranno disponibili contributi a fondo perduto per 7,3 milioni di euro destinati a sostenere le micro, piccole e medie imprese ed i lavoratori autonomi piemontesi nell’attivazione di operazioni finanziarie connesse ad esigenze di liquidità. Una delibera approvata oggi dalla Giunta regionale su proposta degli assessori Elena Chiorino, (Lavoro), Andrea Tronzano (Attività produttive) e Vittoria Poggio (Commercio) consente ai beneficiari dei finanziamenti concessi dal 17 marzo al 31 dicembre 2020 e finalizzati ad esigenze di liquidità di far fronte agli oneri connessi al credito e, in via generale, sostenere l’attivazione di tali operazioni da parte delle banche e degli intermediari abilitati. A gestire le pratiche sarà Finpiemonte. Per approfondire Ore 11.30. Giusta la linea del rigore. A Uno Mattina il presidente Alberto Cirio ha poi dichiarato che ""la situazione del Piemonte deve farci mantenere alta l'attenzione e ci dimostra che la linea del rigore che abbiamo adottato è quella giusta.

It defines America as inherently and irredeemably bigoted, denounces all whites as racial oppressors, and diminishes all blacks as racially oppressed victims. Lies, lies, lies. The third lie is the worst. Black Lives Matter, the “diversity” police, and other “systemic racism”-mongers relentlessly claim that white privilege and white supremacy blockade black success. Blacks think, “Yes, we can.” The Democrat left replies: “No, you can’t.” ... So, blacks are paralyzed victims, as helpless as butterflies ensnared in a tarantula’s web of white racism. This frightful fantasy is concocted to leave blacks cold and scared—all the better to swaddle them in the warm, loving arms of the left. Ultimately, like every Democrat effort, this is about getting elected, retaining power, and controlling Americans as tightly as possible. ... “In other words,” American Enterprise Institute scholar Frederick M. Hess writes, rather than “suggest that individuals can shape the course of their lives, teachers should push students to view themselves as passive victims of circumstance. Harvey is literally instructing teachers to … dismiss individual accomplishment and personal agency.” These “anti-racist” racists are serving social cancer from huge, boiling cauldrons. They are ladling defeatism into the bowls of black people and sickening the entire nation with their evil stew. They must be ridiculed, shunned, defunded, and dismantled."" https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/05/21/democrat-lefts-critical-race-theory-preaches-black-failure/",https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/05/21/democrat-lefts-critical-race-theory-preaches-black-failure/,NA,NA,Democrat Left’s Critical Race Theory Preaches Black Failure,"Black Lives Matter, the “diversity” police, and other “systemic racism”-mongers claim that white privilege blockades black success.",NA,NA,NA,-24,Marshall County TN GOP,2021-05-25T00:00:00Z

Căutăm, în Cluj sau în apropiere, cazare temporară și grijă pentru Frișca. La adopție, nu îndrăznim să ne gândim. Avem nevoie de un om bun, care are timp. Frișca e un câine spre perfect, are 8 luni și o afecțiune ortopedică care o face să stea mult jos și să nu se poată ridica singură, pe picioarele din spate. Ne-am întâlnit și ne iubim de când proprietarii ei, după diagnostic, ne-au spus că n-au nevoie de un câine bolnav. Toată tărășenia am povestit-o aici: www.facebook.com/socialTAC/posts/3232339226904644
 
CE TREBUIE SĂ POATĂ ȘI SĂ FACĂ OMUL:
● Amenajarea unui spațiu îngrădit, în casă, cu așternut moale, unde Frișca să se odihnească.
● Dus afară în brațe, pentru pip & cac. Frișca nu e incontinentă (nu face pe ea), dar nu se ridică pe picioarele din spate și nu merge singurică. 
● Dat medicamente. Le ia ușor, ascunse în mâncare. 
● Fizioterapie simplă, de bază: mișcări ale picioarele din spate și masaj, două-trei sesiuni zilnice x 10 minute.
● Adus la cabinet cu mașina personală sau taxi, când e nevoie, rar. Sau primit acasă o echipă de doi medici TAC, dacă e mai simplu să vină cabinetul la ea. 
 
CÂT TIMP: 2-3 luni. În acest timp, noi vom face (și) mai multe investigații care să ne ducă la diagnosticul cert și decizia-alegere: chirurgie, cărucior sau eutanasie. În prezent, căutăm, în România și în Ungaria, RMN-ul veterinar și specialistul autentic care să o primească. 

În afara problemei cu ridicarea, Frișca e un câine obișnuit și foarte vesel. Cam alintat. Diagnosticul ei parțial și înfuriat e „displazie bilaterală de șold cu embolism fibrocartilaginos”. 
 
CE OFERIM: absolut tot ce e nevoie, de la saltea la mâncare. De tratament nu se pune problema, totul e în grija noastră. De asemenea, decontăm combustibilul pentru mașină sau taxiurile și orice alte cheltuieli directe. (Nu va fi nevoie de multe drumuri.) 
Am oferi și bani, dacă nu ne-am teme că anunțul nostru ar atrage oameni mai puțin buni. Deci, NU OFERIM BANI.
Omul bun se va afla permanent în legătură cu echipa noastră, în special cu dr. Ioana, cea care s-a dat (și) până acum peste cap pentru Frișca. Pentru cine nu ne cunoaște, e exclus ca omul să rămână cu Frișca sau problemele ei, cum exclus e și să uităm de ea sau alte grozăvii. TAC. e o echipă de medici veterinari cu onoare și obraz.
 
Vă mulțumim pentru toate donațiile de până acum și viitoare, pentru Frișca. Mai ales pe oamenii care donează cu IBAN și cu care, deci, nu putem comunica direct, îi invităm să se înscrie la scrisoreta TAC, ca să le putem mulțumi cum se cuvine: tinyurl.com/scrisoreta

TO BE KILLED: APR. 27, 2021

Sweet Senior Meredith is very social with handlers but will require a only pet home can you help!? 🙂 The queen of the belly rubs! Age may just be a number, but a golden heart is forever! Meredith is our 10 year old princess deserving a loving home before the shelter decides her fate. Her frosted face and huge brown eyes have much experience, as do the telltale signs of being a momma at some point in time. Who would expect her to shake and wiggle with excitement like the youngsters do? She seems to forget her age in the presence of treats. Her video shows how filled to the brim with life she is, as well as how lovable she is to people. Her aversion to other dogs is why the shelter decided she doesn't deserve a fair chance to find an adopter or foster. After becoming acquainted with her and viewing her video, the evidence is very clear, she is a joyful doggie who will bring much happiness into a home. What are the chances of a fun loving, affectionate, spry senior finding love when there are so many younger souls begging at the shelter? Surely her desire to connect with people, her excitement over treats and her ability to shake, rattle and roll might set her apart. Don't forget about those belly rubs!  Sadly her time is numbered. The only walk we want to see her take is her freedom walk. If you can foster or adopt this uniquely deserving senior, please message our page now!

Medium Mixed Breed, BROWN BRINDLE unaltered female 
Came into shelter as a STRAY 
Medical Behavior Evaluation: 
Behavior Assessment Rating: New Hope only 
INTAKE DATE: 4/18/2021

PET PROFILE: 
My health has been checked.
My vaccinations are up to date.
My worming is up to date.
I have been microchipped.

Due to arrival as a stray, Meredith's history is unknown. In the care center, she has displayed high levels of reactivity to dogs, lunging, barking, and growling at them. Meredith's has been observed to redirect this frustration and arousal by jumping up toward her caretakers and grabbing the leash in her mouth. This has caused concern for posing a bite risk to her caretakers while in a heightened state of arousal. She has appeared friendly and social when one-on-one with human handlers, though may quickly become overly aroused upon hearing other dogs in the shelter, even when out of sight. She leans into petting, is solicitous with handlers, and has been very treat-motivated. Meredith would succeed best outside of a shelter or boarding environment, and should be kept out of areas with high levels of dog traffic. It is recommended that Meredith be conditioned to wearing a basket muzzle in instances where she may encounter other animals outdoors. She requires an adult-only, single pet home.

The question was direct and simple. Are you in favor of teaching cert in the Fall River School System?

As of this date, I have only received one response. I should say I did not tag anyone only because I know many candidates in all the races read my page or watch my show because when they don't like something they comment. Having said that Shelly Pereira did comment and I will post it below. First let me just say this, thank you for answering my question and I very much appreciate it. I also appreciate how you articulate your view. I believe that is critical. I believe what else is critical is the fact that people learn and understand what critical race Theory actually is. I think that is really confusing to most. However, I will say as a substance use disorder counselor for over 25 years I took numerous trainings and coursework in different forms of cultural diversity. One in particular was understanding Multicultural diversity. I believe was the best I ever took covering almost every call Drew we encounter. Critical race Theory unfortunately does teach that people are judged by the color of their skin and in some way their class. That is my major problem. Like you I believe everything in history should be taught. As we teach our children hopefully you learn from your mistakes. And many have been made throughout history as it pertains to how different cultures and races were treated including the white man. Which by the way no one ever talks about. Enclosing I understand your dance and I personally believe that you have a good understanding and personal grasp of the issue. Elementary middle and high schools should be teaching traditional education. Maybe we should talk and think about political science in middle and high schools so we would have a better educated generation coming up when it's time to vote. And I also believe we need to bring back geography as I believe many young people and old have no idea about the subject. I would enjoy a lengthy conversation all about these issues as I am extremely interested in them and believe they play a major major role in development and direction of our children.

(From school committee candidates Shelly Pereira.)

Hello Gene St Pierre     I just got out of work and saw this post. I’ll try my best to answer and touch on all the comments. This however is a pretty in-depth question that’s difficult to answer in a simple Facebook comment. First of all CRT is an academic course load or movement. It’s not always exactly a class. I have taken some of the derivatives when I was in college. Basically classes that talk about race in relation to social movements and formation of laws. I will say that through my course of study I never felt that it was teaching people to hate white people. And I think that needs to be understood. I certainly do not harbor any white guilt. However with that being said I am NOT in favor of critical race theory or it’s derivatives being taught in our elementary school, middle school or quite frankly high school. I have actually been asked this question several times through my campaign. I’ve answered it in person as well as on Facebook when people have asked. I was quite surprised that at our forum it wasn’t brought up. There was one question asked by the Fall River reporter wanting to know if we agreed with a school district that terminated a teacher because she did not follow school policy in relation to social media posts. But it didn’t ask us if we thought CRT should be implemented in the classrooms. My reasoning for saying no is that it is an extremely in-depth complicated topic that I do not think children of that age are able to understand or absorb. I think it’s an important topic for those who are choosing to go to school for social work, law-enforcement, legal studies and fields such as that. This has been in the academic arena for as long as I can remember. And I do believe understanding these concepts is helpful in certain professions. I will say that I think teaching truth in history is important. And I don’t think anybody would disagree with that. I think it’s important that all children sitting in our classrooms have their stories told. Which means I am for an ELA class let’s say reading books from men, women people of color etc. I think it’s important that our diverse classrooms have diverse education. ALL children benefit from this. Fall River already has curriculum set forth by the state that implements this. I do wish that teachers had more autonomy in the books let’s say they are choosing. I feel that educators go to school to educate and they should have a more hands on affect on our curriculum.  But that is much different than teaching critical race theory. I have talked to some other candidates, I have not spoke to anybody who wants to implement it but I haven’t spoke to everyone about this. There is a thought by one (truncated)",NA,NA,NA,-34,NA,2021-10-28T00:00:00Z

The election of Trump and other fascist racist White supremacist politicians, who are limiting the right to vote for millions of people, including minorities, in red states, in order for republicans to win elections by default, and who inspired the assault on the congressional Capitol building on January 6th, 2021, a failed coup, by falsely claiming that the election was stolen from Trump, is a very strong indication that CRT, Critical Race Theory (Systemic Institutional White-Supremacist Racism) is an indispensable social study course, which should be taught in all schools in order for the USA to have a realistic chance to morph from a fascist, racist White supremacist biblical ignorant violent oligarchical hegemonic exploitative empire
(the military industrial complex according to President Eisenhower) 
into a truly civilized humane social democracy in the future for the first time in history, and thus avoid the inevitable implosion and collapse, which, according to history, is the inevitable destiny of all empires, as a result of repeating history instead of learning from it.

ENRICHMENT NOTES: 7/05/20 Lying down in the litter box, but looks up at me and lip licks. Ears tilt slightly sideways, but will lean forward to sniff my hand. Hesitant of touch, shifting away slightly, but once pet she'll warm up slightly and leans in for cheek rubs. She shows interest in treats and will slowly eat them afterwards. Seems nervous and unsure, but has potential to warm up. 7/07/20 Lying in the cubby, but pokes head forward when the door opens and sniffs my hand. Was a little hesitant of touch, but accepts it and starts to warm up. Seems more curious and will look around the room, but continues to allow petting and eats tuna offered. Doing better! 7/08/20 Lying at the back of her cubby, will chirp when opening door but keeps her distance. Will lean forward to sniff my hand then squint and lip lick. Does allow petting and even leans in a little for cheek rubs. Is a cutie, but is still timid. 7/09/20 Was more out going today, even attempted to re-eval but got more shy towards the middle of the assessment. She comes out of her cubby all chirpy when opening her kennel door. She will sniff my hand right away and then instantly leans in for petting while touched, even purring! But when pet for a while she begins tensing up, observing the room more and being more hesitant. She did tolerate pick up towards the end, but waved her feet around and tensed up. Didn't hiss or growl, ate treats after. May need a re-eval in the next few days if she continues to warm up.

ENRICHMENT NOTES: 7/05/20
Lying down in the litter box, but looks up at me and lip licks. Ears tilt slightly sideways, but will lean forward to sniff my hand. Hesitant of touch, shifting away slightly, but once pet she'll warm up slightly and leans in for cheek rubs. She shows interest in treats and will slowly eat them afterwards. Seems nervous and unsure, but has potential to warm up.

7/07/20
Lying in the cubby, but pokes head forward when the door opens and sniffs my hand. Was a little hesitant of touch, but accepts it and starts to warm up. Seems more curious and will look around the room, but continues to allow petting and eats tuna offered. Doing better!

7/08/20
Lying at the back of her cubby, will chirp when opening door but keeps her distance. Will lean forward to sniff my hand then squint and lip lick. Does allow petting and even leans in a little for cheek rubs. Is a cutie, but is still timid.

7/09/20
Was more out going today, even attempted to re-eval but got more shy towards the middle of the assessment. She comes out of her cubby all chirpy when opening her kennel door. She will sniff my hand right away and then instantly leans in for petting while touched, even purring! But when pet for a while she begins tensing up, observing the room more and being more hesitant. She did tolerate pick up towards the end, but waved her feet around and tensed up. Didn't hiss or growl, ate treats after. May need a re-eval in the next few days if she continues to warm up.

Please read his story👇👇
🐾💔Lived in a crate for most of his life😢‼ 2 year old Simba is completely at a loss as to what life is all about.  His rescuer then dumped 😡him quickly at a police station where because of an incident, the ACC is portraying him like a bad dog.  HE IS SCARED PUP AT ACC‼🙏and we can conclude that he was also freaked out at the precinct.  He refused the food offered to him, so the officer took the food and walked away, where Simba then bit the policeman’s pant leg.  The temp adopter said there’s no resource guarding seen in Simba, so what is it?  Scared animals think that humans are out to hurt or do something bad to them.  Imagine an injured cat , how angry and suspicious  he must be, and to approach him is foolish.  Dogs behave the same way when they are badly scared, they are on guard to defend themselves. That’s nature. Simba thought the policeman is a threat, he was suspicious and scared, didn’t accept the food, and lashed out when he thought he had the opportunity.  The notes said no provocation, which we humbly say there probably was, but might be perceptible only to the experienced dog person. The crucial point is Simba has not had good experiences with humans.  His adopter said he is a happy excitable puppy, which no one has seen up to this point.  This young boy has not had a life of comfort. In fact his life from the beginning, living in a crate, then 1 week of happiness at home with his adopter,  then betrayal by this very person.  Dumped at the police station then dumped at the ACC.  From the four small walls of his crate, Simba most probably never imagined that his brief taste of freedom and “love” would end this way.  Dogs like Simba need our compassion and understanding, he needs us to help him find the miracle that he needs to get out alive.  We ask you, please help however you can, help this poor puppy who is most likely just over a year old.  He needs a committed experienced home with no children, because he is so scared at the ACC.   Please help Simba, he dies today! 

Simba is fearful & needs an experienced, caring owner and home ASAP.

*BEAUTIFUL SPAYED TORTIE - KARIZMA - NOT EATING! CONCERN FOR HEPATIC LIPIDOSIS! NEEDS PLACEMENT ASAP!*

ACC NYC - Brooklyn Center

Medical team writes: Karizma is super stressed and does not really tolerate handling and has lost 4 pounds in the past couple weeks and also did not eat for 5 days in a recent foster home. She does not seem to be eating her food and definitely not her gabapentin either.  Our vets fear that her prolonged anorexia could lead to hepatic lipidosis due to obesity

Our behavior team writes: Karizma is indeed very stressed. She likes to squeeze against the back of the cubby and although she growls, she tolerates very gentle strokes on the body. Our behavior team has tried offering all of our high value food/treats but she is too nervous to eat any of them in their presence. Even if they give her space, she doesn’t show any interest in food.  She may be deteriorating and doesn’t seem to be improving despite the behavior team meeting with her every day.

Hello, my name is Thanos. My animal id is #87432. I am a desexed male white dog at the Brooklyn Animal Care Center. The shelter thinks I am about 1 years 3 weeks old.

I came into the shelter as a owner surrender on 2/16/2020, with the surrender reason stated as animal behavior - aggressive towards people.

Sorry, this pet is for new hope partners only.

Thanos it at-risk for behavior reasons. Thanos was originally surrendered at our Queens resource center and transferred to the Brooklyn Care Center in early January because his owner’s landlord would no longer allow a large-breed dog at the residence due to “breed” restrictions, and because other residents complained about barking when Thanos was left alone. From the onset Thanos exhibited signs of separation anxiety by whining and barking, but responded well when ACC staff sat with him playing soft music. Thanos was adopted by a family with a young child but returned one day later due to some aggression issues that made the child and parents feel uncomfortable. In particular, Thanos would bite at the families feet, often grabbing on to their shoes as they walked by, though never breaking through the shoe to reach skin. While in the shelter Thanos has been difficult to handle and becomes very jumpy and mouthy when handlers attempt to collar and leash him. On 2/26/20 Thanos jumped towards the face of one of his handlers with an open mouth but was thankfully intercepted by a second handler and brought back to his kennel with no incident. Thanos is a big dog weighing in at 70 lbs so when he does jump it can be startling. Allowing Thanos time to decompress and relax in a less stressful environment will better position him for the possibility of permanent placement into a home. This is why we are seeking placement with a New Hope partner. Medically Thanos is healthy.

You may know me from such films as...
https://youtu.be/5Oa_XDwII9I

Let's get to know each other a bit more...
A staff member writes: ""I am inevitable."" More like ""I am adorable and loveable."" Thanos is a handsome, sweet boy who is just looking for someone to call his family. He is nothing like Thanos from Avengers, that's for sure. He is all smiles and butt wiggles. Come visit the good and cute version of Thanos today at Staten Island ACC!

TO BE KILLED - DEC. 3, 2020

This cute face, wearing a tux is Bruckner, but he should be called Peter Pan as he believes he is still a puppy. He has all the joy, happiness, playfulness and energy as a wee puppy does. As well, he trusts everyone and is thrilled to be engaged with anyone. Social butterfly personified! He is always with a soft, wiggly body, and does like to connect by jumping up. He has the most positive spirit, and wants to spread good cheer everywhere. While there is no history on him, he must have known love since he has so much of it to share. We feel his astuteness will make him a quick learner.While Bruckner might never intend on growing old in spirit, he does surely want his own family to grow old in years with. He's a simple, accepting, down to earth doggie who is on a mission on making his friends happy. Message us if you are interested in handsome, sweet, silly and fun Bruckner.

ENERGY LEVEL:We have no history on Bruckner so we cannot be certain of his behavior in a home environment. However, he is a young, enthusiastic, social dog who will need daily mental and physical activity to keep him engaged and exercised. We recommend long-lasting chews, food puzzles, and hide-and-seek games, in additional to physical exercise, to positively direct his energy and enthusiasm.

BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION:Level 3

Recommendations:

No children (under 13)

Recommendations comments:

No children: Due to the potential arousal issues Bruckner has displayed at the care center, we recommend an adult only home.

Potential challenges:

Basic manners/poor impulse control

Ron DeSantis has signed a ‘Parents Bill of Rights’ that would give Americans more say over schools’ education of their children. HB 241 was sent to the governor’s desk on Friday after being passed during the legislative session that ended on April 30. It spells out the rights of parents to “direct the education and care of his or her minor child,” which includes the right to “access and review all school records” related to the students. It would also allow for opt-outs regarding any LGBTQ or sex education classes, as well as the right to opt children out of getting certain vaccinations. Those who back the bill see it is a necessary means to check a school system that has gotten increasingly aggressive and politicized. “What we are seeing is government power is slowly encroaching and expanding. It will do so until the parents assert the rights that they have, but they have to know what those rights are in order to assert them,” Senate sponsor Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero, said in April. Critics eager to use the schools push the LGBTQ agenda in the faces of Christian parents slammed the bill, since it “could compel schools to out LGBTQ youth who face unsupportive or dangerous home environments.” The schools have become a central battleground for the future of the nation, which is something the radical left has long recognized. Governor Ron DeSantis has been taking executive action to ban Critical Race Theory from being taught in the schools, and has emphasized that the “evils of communism and totalitarianism will be taught.” DeSantis has also moved to protect biological females from having to compete against biological males who self-identify as girls in school sports. It has become increasingly clear by contrast that Ron DeSantis is one of the few GOP governors willing to fully use his executive authority to ensure that the will of Republican voters is actually represented.

LUNA (a precious Sharpei mix ) STROLLS SLOWLY AROUND one of the outside areas at the Manhattan shelter where the volunteers take dogs to get some fresh air, relieve themselves and show them love. For a moment Luna stands there looking lost, hoping to catch a glimpse of something familiar, or just a whiff of something she once knew but there is nothing; nothing that reminds her of home, her family or her favorite stuffie or blanket. Just strangeness and a fear that this may just be the last time. Luna's a cutie with a chunkie frame made for cuddling and slow walks. Someone adored her not that long ago and shared their love and treats with her. At just 4 years old we're hoping Luna will be among the lucky within the next 48 hours and finds a solid, loving BFF or a whole new family to love her enough to keep always keep her safe. Please help us share Luna for a second chance.

Behavior History
Behavior Assessment
Luna appeared highly stressed during the intake - panting and whining. The owners had her muzzled and on a very short leash with her harness. The counselor was able to feed her True Chews treats through the muzzle and Luna did not growl, bark, or show any concerning behavior towards the counselor. Counselor had the owner place the slip lead and remove her harness, but counselor was able to walk Luna to the kennel without any issue and remove the muzzle once in kennel. Luna showed no concerning behaviors towards the counselor during the intake process, apart from clear signs of stress.

Date of Intake: 2/2/2020

Spay/Neuter Status: Spayed

Basic Information:: Luna is a 5 year old spayed large mixed breed being surrendered due to aggression towards both people and animals. The owners have a new baby and the stress is too much for them at this time.

Previously lived with:: 3 adults 1 child 1 baby

How is this dog around strangers?: Luna will lunge and bark at strangers both on the street on leash and if strangers enter her home. The owners believe she will bite if she is allowed to get close enough. She can warm up to people, especially with the use of treats. The 2nd owner stated that this is how she bonded with Luna - lots of treats and going slow and now Luna views her as her other owner.

How is this dog around children?: Luna interacts in a limited capacity with the children in the home due to her behavior. She has never shown any concerning behavior towards either the 6yo child or the new baby, but the family do not allow them to interact much at all as she is aggressive with strangers and animals.

KNOWN HISTORY:

The cat was brought in with limited information on his behavior history in a home environment.

ENRICHMENT NOTES:

1/17/21
Crouched in cubby with wide pupils. Tenses up on approach and lip licks unsure. Not interested in treats offered. Shifts away from touch. Stressed. Needs some time to adjust. Gave cubby cover.
1/21/21
Hesitant, sitting upright facing the back of the cubby. Alert with eyes wide. Accepted pets but looks away. No interest for the bubble show for visual stimuli.

EVALUATION:

ACTIVITY LEVEL:

Subdued

VOCAL:

Quiet

CHARACTER TYPE:

Timid

 

Skittish

 

Independent

POTENTIAL CHALLENGES:

New home adjustment period

 

Fearful

 

Adult cat socialization

Potential challenges comments:

Please see flyer.

BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION:

Level 3

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Adult only home

BEHAVIOR SUMMARY:

The cat was on top of the sibling when approached by the assessor. Anxiously looking around with eyes wide, pupils dilated. Accepted pets but remained unresponsive throughout the interaction. No interest for offered treats nor catnip (sprinkled on the bedding).

The cat tolerates brief attention and petting but may be fearful or stressed in the shelter, and may be intimidated by small children. He may be a little more independent, and may need time to warm up to his new home. The previous owner stated that both cats have been together since kittens for that reason, we recommend that they are adopted as a pair. Due to the behaviors seen in the care center, we feel that this cat will do best in an experienced, adult only home.

TO GET STARTED IMMEDIATELY SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE TO THIS PAGE (click ""Send Message"" from our home page). We will respond asap.  You will be directed to complete an app with a registered 501(c)3 New Hope Rescue Partner,  who is approved to pull cats from the NYC ACC (shelter). We will immediately alert the rescue of your incoming app. 

ABOUT TRANSPORT: In most cases there is FREE TRANSPORT to your area up to a 4 hr. radius outside of NYC, including all or part of NY, NJ, CT, PA, NH, VT, RI, MA, MD, DE & DC (see the transport map provided).

ABOUT KITTENS: Kittens under 8 wks old & 2 lbs in weight are NOT PUBLICLY ADOPTABLE,  due to their fragility.  They can only be pulled by a rescue for specially-trained pre-approved kitten foster homes in NY, NJ & CT.   Kittens over 8 weeks and 2lbs should preferably go in PAIRS.

ABOUT PLEDGES: Pledges are directly paid to the 501(c)3 NEW HOPE RESCUE PARTNER that pulls the the cat. Pledges do not guarantee a cat's life will be spared but may help a rescue org decide if they can afford to pull the cat and cover his/her vet expenses.

Scopre di essere positiva al Coronavirus al tampone solo diciotto giorni dopo aver fatto il tampone. Accade ad una commessa di Ariano Irpino (Avellino), l'episodio viene comunicato via social dal suo medico di base. Si scatena il caos, il dottore cancella il post, ma ormai “la frittata è fatta”. 
L'eco della vicenda è amplificata proprio dal luogo in cui è avvenuta. La città di Ariano è quella della provincia di Avellino ad aver pagato il prezzo più caro come vittime e contagi. Oltre la metà dei morti e dei positivi, in Irpinia, si è registrata proprio nella città del Tricolle.

La dirigenza di Biogem, laboratori dove è stato analizzato il “tampone” della discordia, ha provato a fare chiarezza sulla situazione.
In una nota stampa si legge: “Nelle cinquemila analisi finora effettuate, a ritmi stressanti, si è verificato un  inconveniente tecnico-informatico nella trasmissione dei risultati di alcune analisi regolarmente e tempestivamente refertate in data 8 maggio. In particolare nel recepire i dati dal database interno, la piattaforma informatica regionale, evidentemente a causa di un crash momentaneo del sistema (come confermato da esperti informatici consultati), ha omesso alcun risultati. Dell’errore si è potuto avere cognizione quando, a seguito di recentissime richieste di notizie sulle mancate risposte, si è proceduto al confronto tra i dati contenuti nel database interno e quelli recepiti nei file excel di trasmissione”.
“Biogem – continua il documento - per spirito di collaborazione in questo momento difficile, si sta sobbarcando ad un lavoro immane. Basti pensare che nella sola giornata di sabato scorso sono stati consegnati ben duemila temponi da analizzare”.

Housetrained:
Yes
Energy level/descriptors:
Medium

Other Notes:

No

For a New Family to Know
Hussle was described as a great, very loving dog that loves attention. Hussle's owner said she wishes she had done a better job at socializing him as he will sometimes bark at strangers and growl at other dogs. Hussle is attached to his owners and sleeps in bed with them. He loves to run around, and take walks. Hussle will use the bathroom outdoors and will use the wee wee pad in the home.
Hussle eats dry food in the home- the brand is Nourish Gut Health.
Hussle is crate trained, but he doesn't need the crate anymore. Hussle is a strong chewer and loves kong toys, and plush toys that he can rip up.

Behavior Notes:
Upon intake, Hussle was muzzled and was walked into the shelter by the behavior team. He was not scanned, collared or photographed at the time due to behavior history reported by his owners.

ASSESSMENT NOTES
Hussle came into the care center with a bite history, having bit the owner's boyfriend and the dog sitter on two different occasions. Both bites happen when he was being handle during a stressful situation and neither bites broke skin. Hussle's owner reported that he is uncomfortable while being crowded and will lunge and snap. He also displays his discomfort during walks; growling and lunging at strangers and other dogs. His owner did report that he is social with smaller dogs. In the care center, Hussle can be taken for walks but he remains fearful and avoidant when off leash. He has also escalated to growling, snapping and attempting to bite when he is uncomfortable, for example when he was restrained for his initial medical examination. Hussle requires a very slow approach and gentle coaxing to engage, and will require extensive socialization and further training in a home setting. He will display clear warning signs when he is uncomfortable (growling, choosing to retreat) and he should not be forced into new situations he is not yet comfortable with. Hussle will need an adult-only, experienced foster home through a New Hope Partner.

A Little Bit About Me

Ezra was brought to the Care Center after owner passed away so no information is known about her behavior in the home. However, she have been social and affectionate with staff at ACC. Ezra will lean into handler when being petted and stay near them. Recently, Ezra has begun to deteriorate at the care center, digging in her kennel, ripping the drain covers up. Because not much is known about her behavior, we suggest she go to an experienced, adult-only home. 

I am a sweet, social, older gal, looking for the perfect forever home!

I have been known to shower my favorite people in love!

My hobbies include snuggling, snacking, and strolling!

A Little Bit About Me
Due to the need for extensive behavior modification, this animal is only available for foster/adoption through one of ACC's New Hope Partners.

Only inquiries made through the completed pre-screener will be forwarded to New Hope partners.

Chisholm has arrived into the care centers as a stray, so his home behavior history is unknown. In the care center he has allowed leashing for walks, but has been uncomfortable with direct approach and has not allowed handling. Chisholm has not yet opened up to displaying social behavior toward handlers. He has appeared fearful of stairs and may succeed best in a home without them. Chisholm displayed minimal reaction when introduced to the helper dog and it is unknown how his behavior around dogs may translate into a home. He may succeed best in an adult-only home that will allow him to decompress at his own comfortable pace.

ASSESSMENT NOTES
Date of assessment:
28-Jul-2021
BEHAVIOR:
Summary:
Chisholm has appeared highly fearful and uncomfortable in the care center, becoming tense and uncomfortable when approached, and actively avoiding handlers. Out of concern for stress level, he is not a candidate for handling assessment at this time.

DOG-DOG:
Summary:
7/28, on-leash: Chisholm does not approach to greet or react to the helper dog.

FUN FACTS:

INTAKE BEHAVIOR:
Date of intake:
27-Jul-2021
Summary:
Social

MEDICAL BEHAVIOR:
Date of initial:
27-Jul-2021
Summary:
Tense, hard barking, growling

ENERGY LEVEL:
Chisholm displays a medium level of energy in the care center. We have no history available on Chisholm. He has appeared fearful during his stay in our care, and it is unknown how his behavior may translate once acclimated in a home environment.

BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION:
New Hope Only

Recommendations:
No children (under 13)
Place with a New Hope partner

Recommendations comments:
No children: Due to the level of fearful behavior observed, a home without children is recommended.

Place with a New Hope partner: The behavior department recommends Chisholm be placed with a New Hope placement partner who is able to provide an experienced adult-only foster home. Force-free, reward based training only is advised when introducing Chisholm to new and unfamiliar situations. Consultation with a professional trainer/behaviorist is highly recommended for guidance to safely manage/modify any behavior Chisholm presents with outside of the care centers.

Potential challenges:
Fearful/potential for defensive aggression

Potential challenges comments:
Fearful/potential for defensive aggression: Chisholm has displayed a high level of fear in the care center, often appearing tense, hard staring, and avoiding interaction. He was observed to growl during his medical exam. Please see handout on Fearful and Defensive Aggression.

For 7 years, he has lived with his person, slept in the bed, and gone on brisk walks.  Now he is uncomfortable and nervous at the shelter!

Loving and loyal is how his personal described him.  Unfortunately the landlord said that Bully had to go, and so now Bully is scared and alone in an uncertain place.  This is a boy that loves long walks and playing with his kong toy. Housetrained Bully has been kept mostly indoors and will sleep with the owner. He knows his commands, responding to sit, come, down, stay, and go outside. He will go on brisk walks on the leash, pulls very hard, and wanders some but comes back when called when off the leash.  He is a good boy, who had a happy life and now is desperately at risk  Please consider opening your home and your heart to Bully and saving his life!  

Bully ID #81692
Neutered male brown dog 
@ Brooklyn Animal Care Center
About 7 years old
Weight 66lbs
Owner surrender on 3/1/2020, with the surrender reason stated as person circumstance- moving - no pets allowed.

Sorry, this pet is for new hope partners only.

Bully was placed at risk due to behavioral concerns; he was first brought to ACC as a stray by the Police as he was running around on the streets. Bully reunited with his family shortly after. However, a few months later, the Bully's previous owners came to ACC to surrender the dog claiming he needed to surrender due to his new living situation, where dogs were not allowed. There were some concerning behavioral issues reported. Bully bit his previous owner, leaving punctures on his hand. He also bit the officer who was attempting to get him into the crate when he was found running around the first time he was here. The officer stated that no skin was broken. He was also reported to display resources guarding, growling and snapping at those who came close. In the Care Center, we have seen this same type of behavior display by Bully. He is very nervous and aware of his surroundings, and has become difficult to handle due to him displaying fearful aggression. As the days pass by, his behavior is deteriorating and he will benefit from placement as soon as possible. We are recommending placement with an experienced rescue partner who can meet the Bully's needs. Bully is otherwise healthy according to our veterinarian staff.

Zip Code: BRONX NY 10456
Medical Behavior Evaluation: 2. Blue
Behavior Assessment Rating: NHO 
INTAKE DATE: 7/12/2021

PET PROFILE: 
My health has been checked.
My vaccinations are up to date.
My worming is up to date.
I have been microchipped. 

Teddy was surrendered due to family issues. Teddy's previous owner states that he is friendly with strangers, the children that he lived with, dogs and cats. At the care center, Teddy has been highly anxious and fearful. He was flailing, screaming and snapping on leash when he first arrived. During the first few days, he remained in kennel, flattened on the floor, shaking. He has warmed up a bit, allowing leashing and walking on leash. However, he has not warmed up enough to allowing handling. He avoids contact and vocalizes. We recommend that Teddy go to an experienced, adult-only home that will allow him the time and space to decompress in his new environment.

Before going any further, we should spend some time defining what “wokeness” means. Wokeness is a kind of shorthand for an area of the American political left that is obsessed with identity politics. This is, as the name would imply, the politics of identity. Thus, people are not rational actors, nor are they necessarily economic units. Rather, they are little more than a collection (or, in the parlance of this ideology, the intersections) of skin color and séxuality. Socioeconomic class might enter into this, but if it does, it’s generally as an afterthought. While Marxism might play some influential role, the wokeists are far more likely to locate the revolutionary subject in, for example, trans-identified black men than it is the working class. One can understand the hostility of the “woke” to the Bernie Sanders campaign in this context: it is much more revolutionary under the guidelines established by wokeism, to put more racial minorities with unusual séxual identities on the board of Lockheed-Martin and Goldman-Sachs than it is to provide for greater economic equality on behalf of their workers. The bedrock of wokeness is not classical Marxist socialism, but something called “critical theory” and in particular its variant “critical race theory.” This has its roots in the Frankfurt School and an early 20th-century Italian philosopher and politician named Antonio Gramsci. Gramsci’s big idea was that cultural power preceded political power. Thus, to have a Marxist political revolution, one first needed a Marxist cultural revolution. This was to be accomplished by a “long march through the institutions.” What this means is that leftists were to infiltrate every institution of significance and gain power within them. We can see the result of this idea today. While American leftists bear little, if any, resemblance to Marxists of old, they have penetrated our institutions and dominate culturally – in academia, in entertainment and increasingly in the economic sphere as well. If one were to read the Communist Manifesto, there are a series of demands at the end, most of which have come to fruition such as universal public education, a progressive income tax, a national bank, and the industrialization of agriculture. This isn’t to say that there is a massive Gramscian conspiracy with thousands of members. Such a thing would be completely impossible to prove or disprove. However, the kernel of the idea has taken root, in part thanks to bona fide promotion in academia, and in part because it simply seems to have largely been a successful operation. Thus “critical theory” is effectively a sociological philosophy and method that involves constant ideological attacks on Western civilization. Its guiding principle is that Western civilization is based on subjugation, dominance and tyranny. This takes many forms including “racism,” “patriarchy,” “heteronormativity” and “cisséxism” – all of which are predicated upon weaponized guilt. Weaponized guilt is essentially taking those elements of Western and Anglo-Saxon culture, which prize even-handedness and “fair play,” and turning them against the culture itself. Indeed, the selection of the name “Black Lives Matter” is a masterstroke in weaponizing guilt: The only possible disagreement (or so say the advocates and allies of the movement) is that you don’t think black lives do actually matter. But, of course, except for extremely isolated, marginalized and numerically insignificant pockets, virtually everyone agrees that all lives have the same value. Indeed, it is a cornerstone of Western civilization and Christian teaching that this is true. It is nearly axiomatic. The Declaration of Independence declares that the basic equality of men is “self-evident.” No one would even know where to begin “arguing” this, simply because it is so accepted as a fact. It’s worth noting that wokeness largely entered the American political vernacular after the fall of the Occupy Movement. This is not an endorsement of either the Occupy Movement specifically, nor economic reductionism and confiscatory tax redistribution schemes more generally. However, it is worth noting that the corporate affinity for a seemingly “radical” form of politics requiring nothing in the way of actual financial sacrifice began after the death of a political movement demanding corporate accountability and economic redistribution starting at the very top. by Sam Jacobs",https://bit.ly/3hfzj6Q,NA,NA,Woke Capitalism: How Huge Corporations Demonstrate Status by Endorsing Political Radicalism,Why are massive corporations siding with an American cultural revolution?

Yesterday, David Ignatius had a piece in the Washington Post that uncovered the attempt of the Trump administration to reorder the Middle East along an axis anchored by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudia Arabia (more popularly known as MBS),  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and Jared Kushner of the U.S.

To make the deal, the leaders involved apparently wanted to muscle Jordan out of its role as the custodian of Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, a role carved out in the 1994 peace treaty between Israel and Jordan that was hammered out under President Bill Clinton. The new dealmakers apparently wanted to scuttle the U.S.-backed accords and replace them with economic deals that would reorder the region.

This story has huge implications for the Middle East, for American government, for religion, for culture, and so on, but something else jumps out to me here: this story is a great illustration of the principles behind Critical Race Theory, which is currently tearing up the Fox News Channel. Together, the attempt to bypass Jordan and the obsession with Critical Race Theory seem to make a larger statement about the current sea change in the U.S. as people increasingly reject the individualist ideology of the Reagan era.

When Kushner set out to construct a Middle East peace plan, he famously told Aaron David Miller, who had negotiated peace agreements with other administrations, that he didn’t want to know about how things had worked in the past. “He said flat out, don’t talk to me about history,” Miller told Chris McGreal of The Guardian, “He said, I told the Israelis and the Palestinians not to talk to me about history too.”

Kushner apparently thought he could create a brand new Middle East with a brand new set of alliances that would begin with changing long standing geopolitics in Jerusalem, the city three major world religions consider holy. It is eye-popping to imagine what would have happened if we had torn up decades of agreements and tried to graft onto a troubled area an entirely new way of interacting, based not on treaties but on the interests of this new axis. Apparently, the hope was that throwing enough money at the region would have made the change palatable. But most experts think that weakening Jordan, long a key U.S. ally in the region, and removing its oversight of the holy sites, would have ushered in violence.

The heart of the American contribution to the idea of reworking the Middle East along a new axis with contracts, rather than treaties, seems to have been that enough will and enough money can create new realities.

The idea that will and money could create success was at the heart of the Reagan Revolution. Its adherents championed the idea that any individual could prosper in America, so long as the government stayed out of his (it was almost always his) business.

Critical Race Theory challenges this individualist ideology. CRT emerged in the late 1970s in legal scholarship written by people who recognized that legal protections for individuals did not, in fact, level the playing field in America. They noted that racial biases are embedded in our legal system. From that, other scholars noted that racial, ethnic, gender, class, and other biases are embedded in the other systems that make up our society. 

Historians began to cover this ground long ago. Oklahoma historian Angie Debo established such biases in the construction of American law in her book, “And Still the Waters Run: The Betrayal of the Five Civilized Tribes” back in 1940. Since then, historians have explored the biases in our housing policies, policing, medical care, and so on, and there are very few who would suggest that our systems are truly neutral. 

So why is Critical Race Theory such a flashpoint in today’s political world? Perhaps in part because it rejects the Republican insistence that an individual can create a prosperous life by will alone. It says that, no matter how talented someone might be, or how eager and dedicated, they cannot always contend against the societal forces stacked against them. It argues for the important weight of systems, established through time, rather than the idea that anyone can create a new reality.

It acknowledges the importance of history.",NA,NA,NA,-8,NA,2021-06-13T00:00:00Z

Upon intake: Miracle allowed all handling and did not display any fractious behavior. ENRICHMENT NOTES: 12.04.2020 Upon approach, Miracle was laying down in the back of his cubby. He was relaxed and calm. His ears and whiskers were forward. His eyes were neutral. When spoken to softly, he was sniffing at the assessor. When attempting to pet, he remained still at first and sniffed the assessor's hand. Then he leaned into petting and was head bumping the assessor's hand. He rolled onto his side and continued to lean into petting. Miracle began to knead and became very relaxed and comfortable. 12.5.20 Miracle was relaxed upon approach. He solicits attention and leans into petting, kneading and purring. EVALUATION: ACTIVITY LEVEL: Moderate VOCAL: Somewhat chatty CHARACTER TYPE: Social Sweet Affectionate BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION: Level 2 BEHAVIOR SUMMARY: Miracle is laying down relaxed in his cubby upon approach. When spoken to softly he yawns and stretches. When the kennel door opens he remains in place with a soft body. Miracle allows all petting on the head and body, leaning in, purring, and kneading. He comes out of his cubby for more attention and leans into assessor purring loudly. Pickup was not attempted due to him being in a top kennel out of reach. Miracle interacts with the observer, appreciates attention, is easy to handle and tolerates all petting.

Today, Americans across the country marched for voting rights.

They recognize that our right to have a say in our government is slipping out of our hands. At a rally in Washington, Martin Luther King III told the crowd, “Our country is backsliding to the unconscionable days of Jim Crow. And some of our senators are saying, ‘Well, we can’t overcome the filibuster,’.... I say to you today: Get rid of the filibuster. That is a monument to white supremacy we must tear down.”

Since 1986, Republicans have worked to limit access to the polls, recognizing that when more people vote, they lose. Those restrictions took off after 2013 when, in the Shelby County v. Holder decision, the Supreme Court gutted the provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required the Department of Justice to sign off on changes to voting in states with histories of racial discrimination. 

That decision opened the way to voter restrictions, but voting laws have come especially fast and furious this year. Republicans have refused to accept that the election of Democrat Joe Biden was legitimate and, in Republican-dominated states, have worked to make sure Democrats do not have the power to elect another president in the future. Between January 1 and July 14 of this year, at least 18 states have enacted 30 laws restricting access to the vote.

Their plan is clearly to make sure those states stay Republican, no matter what the voters actually want. 

This lack of competition destroys Democrats’ chances of winning elections, but it also pushes the Republican Party further and further to the right. With states sewn up for a Republican victory, potential Republican presidential candidates have to worry less about winning a general election than about winning the primaries. 

Because primary voters are always the most energized and partisan voters, and because for the Republicans that currently means staunch Trump supporters, those vying to be Republican front runners are the Trump extremists: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, for example, and even Florida’s Matt Gaetz and Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently have been touring the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire attacking mask requirements and vaccine mandates, critical race theory and the infrastructure bills currently under discussion in Congress.  

Vote-rigging in Republican-dominated states leads logically to a Republican extremist winning the White House in 2024. 

Congress has before it two voting rights bills that would help to restore a level playing field between the two parties. One, the For the People Act, protects the right to vote, ends partisan gerrymandering, limits corporate money in elections, and requires new ethics rules for elected officials. The House passed the For the People Act in March.

On Tuesday, August 24, the House passed the second of the two voting rights bills, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021, also known as H.R. 4, which expands the system of preclearance that had been in the 1965 Voting Rights Act before 2013. Under the John Lewis bill, the Department of Justice has to sign off on voting changes not simply in states with a longstanding history of discrimination, but also in states anywhere in the country that have shown a pattern of violations of voting rights.

Both of these measures are stalled in the Senate, where Republicans, who insist that states, not the federal government, must have the final say in who gets to vote, have vowed to filibuster them. Unless the Democrats can agree to carve out an exception to the filibuster for voting rights, the measures will die. 

And today, Americans across the country marched for voting rights. 

Today is the 58th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It was on this day in 1963 that the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., gave his “I Have a Dream” speech. 

Dr. King anchored the speeches for the day, though: before him spoke the chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a young John Lewis. Just 23 years old, he had been one of the thirteen original Freedom Riders, white and black students traveling together from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans to challenge segregation. “It was very violent. I thought I was going to die. I was left lying at the Greyhound bus station in Montgomery unconscious,” Lewis later recalled.

Two years later, as Lewis and 600 marchers hoping to register African American voters in Alabama stopped to pray at the end of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, mounted police troopers charged the marchers, beating them with clubs and bullwhips. They fractured Lewis’s skull.

The attack in Selma created momentum for voting rights. Just after the attack, President Lyndon Baines Johnson called for Congress to pass a national voting rights bill. It did.

ENRICHMENT NOTES:

3/09/20
Crouched over by the back, but makes eye contact when approached and lip licks. Seems unsure, but will sniff hand when extended and accepts petting. She slowly starts to warm up and pushes up against my hand gently, leaning in for pets, and then slowly lifts her rear. Her tail remains lowered, still nervous, but is sweet and affectionate.

3/12/20
Lying in her den on approach. Comes out when spoken softly and makes eye contact with slightly dilated pupils. Not interested in treats offered. Accepted gentle petting without escalating today but still seems a hesitant and a little tense. Has potential to warm up.

Seguem minhas “opiniões” sobre o tema proposto.
1. A análise da cinemática do trauma / biomecânica do trauma mostra uma agressão com arma branca com profundidade estimada de pelo menos 20 cm com objeto “incluso / cravado” no tórax;
2. A vítima apresenta parada cardiorrespiratória constatada na primeira avaliação efetuada por uma Equipe de Suporte Básico de Vida (SBV);
3. Ambulância de Suporte Básico de Vida  é composta de pelo menos 2 socorristas em nível  Técnico de Enfermagem (profissional oriundo da área de saúde) , Condutor Socorrista (profissional não oriundo da área de saúde) e, em vários locais do país, por leigos treinados não oriundos da área de saúde (bombeiros civis, bombeiros militares, dentre outros).  Essas classificações estão dispostas nas Portarias GM/MS nº 2.048/2002 e mesmo número 2048/2009), respectivamente “Regulamento Técnico Estadual  das Urgências “ e ”APH como componente do SUS – Sistema Único de Saúde”; 
4. Diante do exposto no item anterior é preciso ter muita cautela e responsabilidade na divulgação de assuntos relacionados a Atendimento Pré-hospitalar (APH) no Brasil, pois é um público com vastas diferenças de conhecimento técnico científico e responsabilidades legais perante o exercício da profissão;
5. O COFEN - Conselho Federal  de Enfermagem e os COREN – Conselhos Regionais de Enfermagem tem frequentemente por meio de portarias e resoluções regulamentado o Serviço de APH no Brasil traçando regramento para atuação do Técnico de Enfermagem e Enfermeiro. Os demais profissionais não possuem o mesmo amparo legal e administrativo por ausência de conselhos ou legislação específica;
6. Tecnicamente, diante de uma situação de parada cardíaca compete ao SBV executar procedimentos para ressuscitação cardiopulmonar (termo utilizado pela American Heart Association) com a aplicação de ciclos de compressões e ventilações de acordo com a respectiva faixa etária (30x2 nesse caso);
7. Os casos de “não ressuscitação” previstos em Manuais de Procedimentos Operacionais dos principais serviços de APH públicos e privados não contemplam a condição proposta;
8. As Diretrizes de Ressuscitação Cardiopulmonar e Atendimento Cardiovascular de Emergências da American Heart Association /ILCOR estabelece como referência de posicionamento das mãos para a compressão torácica a “metade inferior do esterno” ;

TO BE KILLED - DEC. 16, 2020

Wowza!!! Did you know Blueberry was this good looking? We didn't. He's gorgeous. Blueberry came into the shelter scared, nervous and confused like all the other companion pets that are losing their families and their homes. He's been a pretty scared boy but he's coming around now and he loves to sniff around and explore the yard, check out what other pooches are in the same boat as him and he enjoys getting attention and affection from the shelter staff and volunteers too but he would enjoy it so much more in a steady and stable loving home with his very own family. Blueberry is such a hunk weighing in at 85 lbs; hunky, athletic and not for the faint of heart. He needs an experienced, kind and caring BFF to come through and save the day. Dont procrastinate. Blue is OUT OF TIME!

Lying down by the back of the kennel, but will turn to face me when the door opens. Leans forward to sniff my hand and pushes up against it when pet gently on the head, but flips her head around when pet along her shoulders and body. Did this twice so I stopped trying to pet on body and focused on her head and cheek area instead. No interest in treats. Needs time to adjust.

Benedetta Bianchi Porro nasce a Dovadola, in provincia di Forlì e diocesi di Forlì-Bertinoro, l’8 agosto 1936. A tre mesi si ammala di poliomielite: guarisce, ma rimane con una gamba più corta dell’altra. A dispetto delle condizioni di salute, s’iscrive alla facoltà di Fisica dell’Università degli Studi di Milano, ma dopo un mese passa a quella di Medicina. Proprio questi suoi studi le permettono, nel 1957, di riconoscere da sola la natura della malattia che l’aveva intanto resa cieca e progressivamente sorda: neurofibromatosi diffusa o morbo di Recklinghausen. La vicinanza degli amici le permette di uscire a poco a poco dal dolore. Due volte pellegrina a Lourdes, scopre in quel luogo quale sia la propria autentica vocazione: lottare e vivere in maniera serena la malattia. Attorno a lei si radunano amici e sconosciuti, mentre con le sue lettere raggiunge molti cuori. Muore nella sua casa di Sirmione alle 10.40 del 23 gennaio 1964, a ventisette anni, con un «Grazie» come ultima parola. Dal 22 marzo 1969 le sue spoglie mortali riposano nella chiesa della badia di Sant’Andrea a Dovadola. È stata beatificata il 14 settembre 2019 nella cattedrale di Santa Croce a Forlì, sotto il pontificato di papa Francesco. La sua memoria liturgica cade il 23 gennaio, giorno della sua nascita al Cielo.*

▶️ **1744, muore Giambattista Vico, è considerato il più grande filosofo dell'epoca moderna, oltre ad essere ricordato come storico e giurista**. Lavorò come precettore fino al 1699 quando vinse la cattedra di Retorica all'Università di Napoli. Formatosi nell'ambito della cultura umanista napoletana, attraverso le letture di Bacone, Gassendi, Descartes e Hobbes, le sue opere includono le ""orazioni inaugurali"", saggi di filosofia e di diritto. La più importante è la Scienza nuova, dove in polemica con Cartesio difende il valore dello studio delle lettere e della storia, rispetto al primato cartesiano delle scienze matematiche e fisiche. La ""scienza nuova"" è la storia che, secondo Vico, deve fondarsi sulla filologia e sulla filosofia e cui va attribuito un valore di verità come per la matematica.

▶️ **1783, nasce Stendhal, annoverato tra i maggiori scrittori francesi dell'Ottocento, le sue opere figurano tra i classici della letteratura europea. Marie-Henri Beyle scelse lo pseudonimo Stendhal, ispirandosi al mondo dell'arte per cui nutriva un profondo interesse. Il nome richiamava la città tedesca Stendal che aveva dato i natali al celebre storico dell'arte Johann Joachim Winckelmann**. Orfano di madre e insofferente al bigottismo del padre, sposò l'impresa napoleonica, arruolandosi nell'esercito e combattendo in Italia, Germania e Russia. Innamorato del Bel Paese e del suo patrimonio artistico (raccontato in alcuni saggi), qui visse a lungo e ambientò uno dei due suoi romanzi più noti: ""La Certosa di Parma"". L'altro, ""Il rosso e il nero"", è uno dei capisaldi della letteratura ottocentesca, nonché un modello ante litteram del romanzo psicologico europeo, portato poi alla massima espressione dai successivi Svevo, Pirandello, Joyce, Flaubert e Dostoevskij. La prosa di Stendhal, d'impronta realista, si caratterizza per uno stile essenziale e per una marcata sensibilità romantica.

▶️ **1832, nasce Édouard Manet, un grande maestro della ""pittura en plein air"" (all'aperto), fatta di pennellate rapide, di vivacità di colori e di una resa naturalistica della luce, e in ciò anticipatrice della corrente impressionista. Strinse amicizia con letterati di grido, come Zola e Mallarmè, e soprattutto con i futuri impressionisti, da Degas a Renoir**. A differenza di questi ultimi, da cui prese le distanze, cercò il riconoscimento delle istituzioni, tentando inutilmente di esporre al Salòn di Parigi. Le sue opere ""all'aperto"", realizzate ai giardini delle Tuileries, alle spalle del Louvre, crearono scandalo e diedero un tratto distintivo alla sua produzione. Restano celebri in tal senso Colazione sull'erba e Olympia.

▶️ **1944, muore Edvard Munch, noto come l'esistenzialista dei fiordi, con la sua pittura anticipò gli aspetti peculiari dell'espressionismo, di cui è considerato il padre**. Dopo aver studiato all'Accademia di belle arti di Oslo, si trasferì a Parigi formandosi sulle opere di Gauguin, Van Gogh e Degas. Dal 1892 al 1902 visse il periodo di maggiore ispirazione, segnato dal capolavoro assoluto: L'urlo. Legato a un episodio reale della sua vita, in esso portò alla massima esasperazione (nei contorni deformati dei soggetti, nell'uso della luce e nel paesaggio fatto di linee (truncated)",NA,NA,NA,-56,NA,2021-01-23T00:00:00Z

Carlos 98877 | Sex M | Age 3 yrs (approx.) | 25 lbs | Small Mixed Breed | Brooklyn ACC | Intake Date: 7-21-2020

Please, note that found pups (Strays) are usually put on a 3-day hold by the shelter before they are available to give the owners a chance to find them.

**************************************
📌 NOTE: For more INFORMATION, TO ADOPT & UPDATES EMAIL the NYC ACC at adopt@nycacc.org - Subject Line: Dog’s Name & ID Number

TO FOSTER OR ADOPT A NYC ACC DOG that is NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, please MESSAGE OUR PAGE Dogs Lives Matter - Saving NYC Dogs or EMAIL us at NYCDogsLivesMatter@gmail.com for assistance.
****************************
📌
NOTE: You MUST live in NY, NJ, PA, CT, RI, DE, MD, MA, NH, VT, ME or Northern VA. You will need to fill out applications with a New Hope Rescue Partner to foster or adopt a NYC ACC dog. Transport is available if you live within the prescribed range of states.
**************************************

BASIC INFORMATION: 
Carlos previously stayed with a dog and a cat and 1 adult. The caller said, the dog is good, but it chewed the door and the sofa. He may have separation anxiety. He it a sweet dog, was great to me (Kat). Carlo's behavior around children is unknown. The caller had a dog and Carlos was good with the dog. Carlos was also good with the cat, as per caller. He has no known bite history. 

PLAYGROUP NOTES - DOG TO DOG SUMMARIES: Carlos's finder reported that he did not display any concerning behavior when interacting with the resident dog. When off leash at the Care Center, Carlos keeps to himself as he wanders in a group of small male and female dogs. He growls at the other small dogs when they sniff his rear of greet him face to face.

Recommendations:
No young children (under 5)
Single Pet Home 
Recommend no dog parks
Recommendations comments:
Recommend No dog Parks: Due to Carlos's uncomfortable behavior during playgroup (see DOG-DOG SUMMARY) the Behavior Department recommends that Carlos not be taken to dog parks. Reward-based, force-free training can be utilized to counter-condition and desensitize Carlos to help him associate other dogs with positive experiences, such as toys or treats.

Adoption Summary:
Carlos would do best in a home with an experienced adopter who is familiar with his breed. He would love to be your one and only and should not go to a home with other pets or young children. 
He's a friendly fella but takes some time to warm up to new people. He has some dental needs that will be the adopter's responsibility.

GUMBO, ID# #124289, 7 yrs old, 72 lbs, male
Brooklyn ACC, Large Mixed Breed,
Surrender Reason: stray
Shelter Assessment Rating: NEW HOPE ONLY
No children (under 13)
Medical Behavior Rating: 3. Yellow

Gumbo is on the emergency placement list due to behavioral reasons. Gumbo has been observed to growl, lunge and hard bark in kennel; he is unable to be safely handled. Medically, Gumbo has dental disease and dermatitis.

INTAKE DATE: 8/18/2021

BEHAVIOR NOTES
Date of assessment:: 8/22/2021

Summary:: Gumbo appeared fearful and highly stressed upon arriving into care center. He did not display social behavior and appeared uncomfortable with direct handling and approach. Since arrival, Gumbo has been observed to lunge, growl, and hard bark in his kennel, charging forward when handlers approach. He has not been receptive to treats or slow approach. Due to Gumbo's observed behavior and inability to safely handle him, we believe that he is not a safe candidate to be placed back into the public.

BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION:: New Hope Only

Recommendations:: No children (under 13),Place with a New Hope partner

Recommendations comments:: No children: Due to the high level of fear and potential for defensive aggression seen at the care center, we recommend an adult only home.

Place with a New Hope partner: Due to the high level of fear and potential for defensive aggression seen at the care center, we recommend placement with a New Hope partner who can provide any necessary behavior modification (force-free, positive reinforcement-based) and re-evaluate behavior in a stable home environment before placement into a permanent home.

Potential challenges: : Fearful/potential for defensive aggression

Potential challenges comments:: Fearful/potential for defensive aggression: Gumbo is highly fearful at the care center, running forward and growling loudly when people approach his kennel. Due to this behavior, he has been unable to be handled at the care center. He will need a very slow approach and positive reinforcement behavior modification. Please see handout on Fearful/potential for defensive aggression.
