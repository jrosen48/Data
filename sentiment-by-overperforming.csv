"**UPDATE** The Daily Local's editor has revised the story to remove the reporter's personal commentary, denoted that the first speaker has never attended DASD, and corrected the inaccurate information regarding the board vote. The Daily Local has planned a follow-up article and in-person coverage at future board meetings to help present a more accurate and balanced report of the evening. *** The Daily Local News published an article yesterday that inaccurately portrayed last week’s board meeting as well as the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work happening in DASD. The Daily Local has revised the article to correct the inaccuracies. To clarify any misconceptions, DASD is not teaching Critical Race Theory (CRT) and there are no plans to do so in the future. The DEI director’s role is not to create, design or revise instructional curriculum (such as critical race theory). The Pennsylvania Department of Education is clear with districts in terms of the curricular standards that we are required to teach, and DASD adheres to them. DASD IS supporting diversity, equity and inclusion by promoting kindness, civility, understanding of people and acceptance of others’ lived experiences and backgrounds. The cultural diversity of our student population has more than doubled in the past 10 years. In DASD, there are nearly 2,200 students receiving special education services, nearly 300 receiving gifted education services and more than 300 receiving accommodations through a section 504 service agreement. According to the Williams Institute, 4.1% of Pennsylvania’s adult population identifies at LGBT. It is our responsibility to acknowledge and respect our differences, and to provide a learning environment where all students feel safe, understood and valued. We must support all staff and students, regardless of gender, race, color, creed, sexual orientation or ability. Schools that are inclusive and foster the whole child are better able to meet the wellness and academic needs of all students. DEI work creates a culture of kindness, respect, compassion and grace. School-wide strategies that align wellness, inclusion, diversity and equity empower all students to meet their individual and unique goals.",Status,10.07,https://www.facebook.com/148341361326/posts/10159156205556327/,2,17,0,2,12,3,40,2,7,20,342,1269,295,770,50,145,1,4,0,1,3
"The Carteret County Public School System’s Board of Education met at 6:00 p.m. at Croatan High School in Newport, N.C. to consider revisions to Carteret County Board of Education Policy 7720 - Employee Political Activities, for first review. In addition, the Board of Education also considered operational protocols based on revisions to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) StrongSchoolsNC Public Health Toolkit for kindergarten through 12th grade. The revision of Policy 7720 - Employee Political Activities was considered for a first read by the Board of Education members. The policy revision included the following statement: This policy should not be construed as prohibiting the impartial study and discussion of political or other controversial issues in the classroom setting, including the dissemination of factual information about serious problems the school system or the community may be facing because of political actions, where such teaching or information reasonably relates to the standards of the course. Both sides of the political issue shall be presented, supported by primary or balanced secondary sources so that students are provided an opportunity to be well informed and to be able to make their own decisions regarding political or other controversial issues. Further, this policy shall ensure that social theories of any kind (i.e. Holocaust Denial Theory, 9/11 Theory, Critical Race Theory) are not presented to students unless approved by the Carteret County Board of Education. It is the responsibility of the Board to ensure that curricular standards are taught using well documented, factual resources and not opinion or conjecture. The Carteret County Public School System does not teach Critical Race Theory, nor are there any plans to do so in the future. The Carteret County Board of Education promotes respect for all persons and encourages school system personnel to incorporate this foundational concept in all instructional activities. Students should be encouraged to think critically, freely, and with a respect for differences of opinion. The Board rejects any curriculum, instructional activity, or instructional resource that devalues any person. The school system’s frequent expression of “#CarteretStrong” is predicated upon the belief that we are “#StrongerTogether.” Superintendent Dr. Rob Jackson gave a detailed PowerPoint presentation on NCDHHS StrongSchoolsNC Public Health Toolkit for kindergarten through 12th grade, which included updates on toolkit revisions, educational experience for students, health and wellness protocols, transportation, child nutrition, cloth face coverings, and quarantine guidelines. Dr. Jackson met with the Health Director and other health officials from the Carteret County Health Department prior to the meeting to ensure the information being presented was accurate and up-to-date. The StrongSchoolsNC Public Health Toolkit states, “If a school does not require individuals who are not fully vaccinated to wear a mask, they should ensure a layered mitigation strategy, including physical distancing, ventilation, hand hygiene, adequate access to diagnostic and screening testing, and closely monitor for increases in COVID-19 cases.” Board members reiterated the priority placed on the health and safety of students and staff and the importance of students attending school face-to-face. After Dr. Jackson's presentation and discussion by Board members, a unanimous decision was made by the Carteret County Board of Education to make masks optional in Carteret County Public Schools. Students and staff members will not be required to wear masks during the 2021-2022 school year, however, mask-wearing is optional for students and staff.",Photo,9.86,https://www.facebook.com/267159566634514/posts/4883428201674271/,5,27,2,4,7,8,38,3,1,44,559,1144,315,254,299,255,2,0,8,9,2
"Clarification of Board Members' Position on Critical Race Theory A recent news article seemingly indicated that four of our current Board of Education members, Cyndee Bratz, Amanda Karpus, John Schweitzer, and Steve Vaughn, support the teaching of Critical Race Theory (CRT) in our schools.

"To our Springboro Families, Springboro Schools would like to address the recent questions and concerns that have been shared by parents and community members regarding Critical Race Theory (CRT) and if CRT is being considered for this district’s curriculum. Additionally, we would like to clarify the purpose of the Superintendent’s Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Committee. Springboro Schools has not and will not support or implement CRT into our curriculum at any grade level. Additionally, our curriculum will not include the following topics that are sometimes associated with CRT: • Teaching from a perspective that the United States and/or its legal system is systematically racist and designed to create and maintain inequalities between genders, ethnicities, different religious heritages, or races • Teaching that socialism and communism are morally superior to democracy, capitalism, and a free market economy • That any gender, ethnicity, religious heritage, or race should feel superior or inferior • That one should feel guilt or shame due to their ethnicity, religious heritage, race, or gender Springboro Schools follows the Ohio Department of Education’s (ODE) Learning Standards. Those standards for social studies were reviewed and adopted in 2018, and do not include CRT. As standards are updated and released, the Superintendent will make recommendations to the Board of Education on whether or not to adopt them. Springboro Schools would not recommend the support of the aforementioned curriculum items that are outlined above. To view ODE’s current standards for social studies, as well as all other subject areas, please visit - http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/OLS-Graphic-Sections/Learning-Standards.:=:http://education.ohio.gov/CMSMessages/PageNotFound.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/OLS-Graphic-Sections/Learning-Standards. The D&I Committee’s focus is on improving the learning environment within Springboro Schools, in order to ensure that every student, regardless of ethnicity, religious heritage, gender, or race, feels welcome, safe, and ready to learn. The D&I Committee is not responsible for the district’s curriculum, nor does it have the authority to implement any changes to it; only the Superintendent and the Board of Education hold that authority. Report-outs and recommendations from the D&I Committee will continue to be public and are still subject to approval by the Superintendent and Board of Education. This is consistent with all other Superintendent committees. Springboro Schools is committed to maintaining our excellent curriculum, which is the educational foundation of countless Springboro graduates who have gone on to enjoy success in numerous pursuits such as college, vocational school, military service, and skilled trades. We will also strive to continuously improve our environment and student experience so that every student is able to feel welcome and safe.

"A Statement From The Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Steve Barnes: We understand that many rumors and misinformation have been circulating online about what the Morgan County R-II School District is teaching, and we’d like to address that so you know what is going on in our classrooms. The number one thing to know is that what has been taught at Morgan County R-II will continue to be taught at Morgan County R-II. To address possible misunderstandings: - We are not adopting Critical Race Theory (or something similar) and we are also not changing words used to sneak in a political agenda or a particular program under a different name. That is not who we are. We will always be transparent about what children are learning in the classrooms and always look for ways to do better when we can. Critical Race Theory (CRT) is not a part of the social studies or any other curriculum, or in the Missouri State Standards, and we have no plan on changing that. CRT is an analytical tool that is used at the university level for evaluating the legal system and is not appropriate for the K-12 curriculum. - We do not have any classes that teach students to be ethnically a certain way. (The example asked about has been – “teaching students to be less white”. That is not and will not be a class.) - We do not have any classes that teach students about their gender roles and responsibilities. (The example asked about has been – “teaching boys to be more effeminate”. That is not and will not be a class.) In summary, the curriculum your children have learned in the past is the same curriculum that will be in place next year. We are aligned directly with the Missouri State Standards, and if you ever have questions about our curriculum, please do not hesitate to call the Central Office at 573-378-4231 or contact your building principal.

"Dear Rocket Nation, As we get closer to our September 7th start date for the 2021-2022 school year, I would like to address a couple of HOT TOPIC issues with you! The first one deals with Masks. Conotton Valley School will not be mandating the wearing of masks. However, we will certainly welcome any student or staff to wear one if they choose. We will maintain our heightened sanitization and hand-washing protocols. Additionally, the Board of Education has purchased air purifiers for every classroom. We will continue to collaborate with the Carroll County Health Department to monitor any outbreaks. Let me assure you that your child’s safety is a priority, and we will do everything possible to provide a clean and safe atmosphere for the educational process to take place. Unless we are required to alter this plan by law, or the Ohio Department of Education, this will be our approach. The second topic is The Critical Race Theory. There is growing debate and controversy centering around the teaching of Critical Race Theory in America’s public schools. Conotton Valley Union Local School District is for ALL students and families, period. As we enter our sixth year of “Leader in Me,” the staff embeds the 7 habits and our Core Values of Honesty, Self-Discipline, Equity, Passion, Growth Mindset, Collaboration, Perseverance, and Responsibility into our daily instruction. We teach Ohio’s learning standards for each grade level and content area. We carefully select curriculum materials and resources to support learning and cause students to process information, engage in thoughtful discussion/debate and think critically for themselves. We empower teachers to utilize evidence-based instructional strategies to create optimum learning opportunities for all students. We create a welcoming, safe, and positive environment for all students, staff, and guests. We treat students and each other with dignity, respect, and kindness. CRT is not part of our curriculum and will not be instructed. Conotton Valley Union Local School District is always prepared for students to question and discuss current events openly and thoughtfully. “We are in control of our mission.” Todd Herman, Superintendent",Status,4.49,https://www.facebook.com/825517197503949/posts/4012584802130490/,3,12,1,2,11,4,37,1,2,30,350,166,87,15,49,14,0,0,0,0,1

"It’s hard to believe that it’s already eight weeks into the school year. While we hoped that this year would allow for a return to normal, that has unfortunately not been the case. The pandemic continues to challenge school districts with positive cases, contract tracing, and quarantine protocols. Schools around the country are also coping with a sharp increase in mental health concerns as well as teacher and staffing shortages. As the school year progresses, it has become clear that many students are struggling nationwide. The crisis in mental health has been growing for years, but the pandemic has accelerated it. Students are facing a number of challenges that are affecting their mental health, including feelings of isolation and anxiety, substance and alcohol use, and the unexpected deaths of loved ones from COVID-19. In response to this, our district has not only expanded our partnership with River Valley Counseling Center, but we have also added eight School Adjustment Counselor positions across our schools to help meet the needs of our students. We know that if our students are not in a healthy mental state, that they cannot adequately access our curriculum, which directly affects student achievement. The COVID pandemic has triggered a spike in teacher retirements and resignations. In addition to teacher vacancies, schools around the country are facing food supply shortages, and struggle to find enough bus drivers, paraprofessionals, custodians and cafeteria workers. Many districts also face shortages of substitute teachers, who are needed now more than ever to cover for teachers who are out sick or quarantined. Some schools have closed when too many positions could not be filled, while others grapple with higher than normal unfilled positions, leaving remaining staff overworked. The lack of qualified teachers in the US has worsened during the pandemic. Difficulties filling teacher openings continue to affect schools across the country. In South Dakota, one district started the school year with 120 teacher vacancies. In Texas, districts in Houston, Waco and other neighborhoods reported teacher vacancies in the hundreds as the school year began. Florida is short over 5000 teachers across the state. Our district still has over a dozen critical positions to fill and it’s already the middle of October. The teacher shortage didn't start with COVID-19. Educators have been leaving the profession for years for a variety of reasons, and the pandemic only exacerbated the situation. According to a June survey of 2,690 members of the National Education Association, 32% said the pandemic was likely to make them leave the profession earlier than expected. Over the last 18 months, teacher workloads have increased considerably along with stress levels. In May, a survey by the CDC Foundation reported that 27% of teachers reported depression and 37% reported anxiety. Further complicating the staff shortages is the fact that fewer students are majoring in education at college and universities. With election season upon us, it is my hope that candidates running for public office realize the actual issues facing our school system. As a community, we need to collaborate to solve the ongoing mental health crisis and lack of qualified school staffing. Schools nationwide have had to shut down classrooms because there just aren’t enough teachers. While this has not happened in Westfield yet, that day may come. Critics focusing on standardized test scores and outdated accountability data during a global pandemic is not helpful. Debating about masks or the myth that Critical Race Theory is being taught in our schools is equally nonproductive. If we truly hope to work together to create an environment where children can learn and thrive and be surrounded by positive role models and examples in their community, we need to acknowledge that our world is hurting, traumatized, and in need of healing. We also need to celebrate the good work that our educators, administrators, support staff and families do every day caring for our children.",Photo,3.78,https://www.facebook.com/546866082025395/posts/4707383669306928/,6,14,1,17,9,25,38,18,5,37,649,102,45,13,17,25,0,0,0,0,2

As approved, the new policy states that the district appreciates diversity of thought, values, perspectives and personhood and is “committed to procedures intended to support a diverse and equitable school community in an inclusive manner.” While presenting it to the school board Monday night, Superintendent Kirt Hartzler said the new policy is not an attempt to subvert state laws or introduce critical race theory into the classroom but is instead an affirmation of the district’s core values. “I don’t know why we wouldn’t want to consider this,” he said, noting that more than 60 languages are spoken by Union students.

I have spent the better portion of my first seven weeks trying to fill key leadership positions which were vacated this past spring and summer. Bit by bit, a new leadership team has been onboarding over the last month and our team is now fully intact. This was the first priority to tackle upon my entry, and I’m very pleased with the quality of candidates we have managed to bring into our learning community. During my short time here, we have found some specific operational systems utilized in business, payroll and human resources in recent years have either been inadequate, lacking appropriate checks and balances, or simply not following best practices for a nearly $40 million organization. To this end, I have spent a great deal of time digging deeper into how and why these systems were either not set up and administered properly, or fixing mistakes generated by a lack of a strategic approach to operations. This is all fixable, but it requires an initial investment of time, during which our new leadership team will thoroughly review files and systems, address and correct errors, and establish clear, redundant protocols and feedback loops for payroll, business and HR operations to run smoothly moving forward. Since my arrival, I have met with various staff members, become acquainted with the people with whom I’m working and have gotten to know the board. Because we have needed to onboard so many new people, I’m also spending time either directly mentoring individuals or reaching out to experienced individuals in neighboring districts or school support organizations to assist in advising some of our new hires. At recent board meetings, I’ve referred to this as triage work and I’ve advised the board that most of my first nine to 10 months on the job will center on this. I have also been asked to recruit someone into the district whom I can mentor to replace me at the end of the 2022-2023 school year, as I prepare to retire. I know some community members are concerned about whether the district intends to revisit the diversity and equity initiative which began last school year. Concerns were raised at a recent board meeting that the district had spent some $500,000 on diversity and equity curriculum and resources. Let me be clear: that DID NOT happen. Someone must have either been confused about a budget discussion on overall K-12 curriculum and professional development and textbook purchasing, or had their own agenda and spread false information. The bottom line is that SMSD has not expended $500,000 on diversity and equity initiatives. Regarding my stance on the formal JEDI initiative that began last school year, and was apparently tabled in the spring or early summer prior to my arrival, I ask that everyone refers to the priorities I’ve discussed in the first three paragraphs of this letter. In the immediate future, my focus is on fixing fundamental operations, preparing to develop a budget for next fiscal year, helping the district find its next superintendent, and working with my new leadership team to prioritize areas in need of immediate correction and fix them. After that, we will develop and implement long-term practices to ensure those areas function properly, well into the future. These areas of priority will occupy almost all of my time and the time of my core leadership team for the remainder of this school year. Finally, regarding curriculum content: public schools are governed by Chapter 4 of the PA School Code of 1949. Over the years, there have been periodic updates to Chapter 4, which outlines what must be included in district curricular content. I have been a superintendent for nearly 18 years, and at no time during that span do I recall any update to Chapter 4 requiring public schools to teach Critical Race Theory as part of our curriculum—though for many, many years, there have been historical references in our guidelines for including discussion and analysis of domestic unrest, and racial and ethnic tension. If CRT had been mandated, every superintendent and curriculum director in the state would have received formal notification of this change—that has not happened, nor is it ever likely to happen. Unfortunately, social media, media punditry and rabid politics have enabled susceptible individuals to be duped into linking any attempt to address concepts like diversity, racial bigotry, marginalization, or inequitable treatment of sub-groups to the so-called culture wars and government indoctrination of children. Here is a link to Chapter 4 on the PA Department of Education website: (truncated)",Link,2.12,https://www.facebook.com/554909947987311/posts/2591667840978168/,5,31,2,6,11,14,53,5,5,37,826,142,89,19,15,17,0,0,0,2,0

We would like to reassure everyone that our district has an open-door to any and all curriculum and instruction related questions. Our building principals and central office leaders are always willing to meet and review our curriculum and instructional material. We welcome the input of our community and value your feedback. Please know that our teaching teams work tirelessly to develop high quality learning experiences for all of our students. With this in mind, we would also like to share the following: 1. All of our curriculum is based on the Missouri Learning Standards provided by the Department of Education (DESE). 2. Neither the Missouri Learning Standards or our curriculum address Critical Race Theory (CRT) or the 1619 Project. Additionally, we have also had questions about the district's Leader in Me program. Leader in Me is based on the book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. This program works to promote leadership and life skills in our students and was started here in 2016. The district researched this program extensively prior to implementation and believes strongly in developing the character and academic skills of all of our students.

"Colonial Heights School Board clarifies policies COLONIAL HEIGHTS, Va. -- Over the past several weeks, citizens and parents in Colonial Heights and across Virginia have expressed concern about news they are hearing at a state and national level related to public schools. As members of the Colonial Heights School Board, we want to collectively assure the citizens of Colonial Heights that our schools continue to be committed to being welcoming and safe places where all students and staff are valued and respected. We embrace equity of opportunity for all students and staff as we work hard together to advance and support student learning and be the best we can be as a community. To be clear, Critical Race Theory is not included in the curriculum for Colonial Heights Public Schools and is not included in current state standards of learning. History and social studies must be studied honestly and accurately, but students are not judged by the color of their skin under any circumstances. We must all be accountable for our actions as individuals, correct wrongs where they exist, and work together united rather than divided for the good of our community. Likewise, Colonial Heights Public Schools has not changed its policies regarding transgender students. We do not discriminate in our schools and will continue to work with students needing support on an individual basis and respect their privacy, in an environment that is safe and respectful of all students. Having worked through the incredibly challenging past year of the pandemic, our schools and community are stronger than ever and there is nothing we cannot face working together.

"Dear Community, As a follow-up to the conversations occurring in our community, I wanted to provide you with information about what is/is not occurring in the Snohomish School District in regard to Critical Race Theory (CRT), sexual education curriculum and use of masks/face coverings. And more importantly, I want to emphasize that the Snohomish School District is dedicated to each and every student’s education and strives to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. Our goal is to ensure that any student who entrusts us with their education earns their diploma while having a safe and positive experience in our schools. As summer is upon us and we prepare for full-time, in-person school next fall, I look forward to continuing our conversations around the quality of education in Snohomish. Thank you for your time, it is a pleasure to serve as your superintendent. Kent Critical Race Theory (CRT) The Snohomish School District does not have a Critical Race Theory (CRT) curriculum or class, nor does the state mandate we do so. Snohomish School District strives for equity through the efforts of removing all barriers to learning and by doing so seeks to honor and value the lives of each and every student, staff, and community member regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, neurodiversity, social class or disability. Masks/face coverings The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Washington State Department of Health, the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) and Snohomish Health District have all noted masks are currently required for all individuals in the school setting (K-12). The district must follow the student health and safety requirements mandated by these entities. This is a state mandate that our neighboring school districts all follow as well. As we work through the summer, we fully anticipate that guidance from federal, state and local health partners may be changing regarding many of the COVID-19 health and safety aspects. Although we have no advance notice of what those changes may be, we will adapt accordingly and throughout the summer district teams will work to prepare our schools, classrooms and spaces to accommodate full, in-person enrollment. We will communicate any changes as soon as we are made aware. Sexual education curriculum Our district offers human growth and development curriculum to students in 5th through 9th grades. Our adopted curriculum used in the classroom, which is available at www.sno.wednet.edu/healtheducation,:=:https://www.sno.wednet.edu:443/healtheducation, went through our public review process which includes community meetings and input. In addition, each time the curriculum is taught we are required to have community meetings so families have the information before instruction so they can decide whether to opt their child out of the lessons. Senate Bill 5395, passed by the Legislature and the voters in 2020, took effect on December 3, 2020. It requires all Washington public schools to provide comprehensive sexual health education instruction that is medically and scientifically accurate, evidence-informed, age-appropriate, aligned with health and learning standards, and inclusive of all students regardless of their protected class status. The bill defines comprehensive sexual health education as recurring instruction in human development and reproduction that is age-appropriate and inclusive of all students. The bill maintains the right for parents/guardians to opt their children out of sexual health education instruction at any time. According to the requirements of Senate Bill 5395: Beginning in the 2021−22 school year • Schools must begin providing comprehensive sexual health education at least twice between grades 6−8 and at least twice between grades 9−12. For example, to meet the requirements for grades 6–8, schools may choose to provide instruction once in grade 6 and once in grade 8. The instruction must also include age-appropriate information about affirmative consent and bystander training. • Schools must inform the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) of any curricula used to provide comprehensive sexual health education and describe how their instruction aligns with the requirements of the bill. •The Snohomish School District adopted human growth and development curriculum used in our 6th through 9th grade classrooms is available at www.sno.wednet.edu/healtheducation.:=:https://www.sno.wednet.edu:443/healtheducation.

There is no sexual health content required for students in grades K–3. • Schools must begin providing comprehensive sexual health education at least once between grades 4−5.

"A message from George Qiao, Chemistry and AP Computer Science teacher, to staff. ""During times like these, it is easy for those of us who are not black to default to inaction. We, after all, were not taught about race in school, were not corrected for our microaggressions, were not given the critical lenses with which to examine our history-by-numbers education. We may worry about saying the wrong thing, reading too deeply into an out-of-touch text, or overstepping at a rally. However, none of this excuses inaction. It is up to us to find ways to be pro-black, and make up for the gaps in our own education we have hitherto blissfully accepted. A couple of you have asked me ""what can I do?"". I imagine that question is rolling around many of our heads. Here are, in no particular order, some answers. 1. Identify and Support Black-Owned Businesses Black-owned businesses have been hit hardest by the quarantine slump. Black entrepreneurs have a harder time finding capital, and must work harder to attract consumers. We can fight this trend by making sure our money is going towards businesses that support their communities... and get some delicious food / beautiful decor along the way. Link below. 2. Attend a Protest, Thoughtfully. We can't just show up physically. Linked below are ways to be more thoughtfully engaged as guests to a movement. Definitely don't be the non-black person loudly yelling ""Hands up, don't shoot"" and expecting others to follow you. 3. Educate and Reflect Upon Ourselves When we learn about race, we are not learning just about a ""theory"". We are not simply criticizing ""racism"". We must examine and criticize ourselves. Linked below is an absolutely massive list of resources to help us do that. I can also give some recommendations not included on this list. 4. Attend a Court Watch What happens to people who get arrested? They get a trial, but who will make sure that due process is upheld? We will, of course. Link below for more info. 5. Donate to a Bail Fund Money talks not just in politics, but in justice as well, unfortunately. Below is a list of bail funds we could donate to. Definitely don't be someone who shows off their donation receipt on social media, though. 6. Critically Examine Our News Sources Journalists, reporters, newswriters, and interviewers at major news corporations are all largely white. If we direct our attention only to these news sources, we will absorb the implicit bias and judgmental language, and fail to truly consider the key perspectives on race and justice. Linked below is a whole list of black news sources we could be reading 7. Refuse to Tolerate Ignorance Around Us: I am sure that many of us know a Trump voter. I am even more sure that many of us know someone who believes that race doesn't matter anymore. Sometimes the most important battles are won between friend and family. If someone is disgusted at ""violent looting"", encourage them to consider the violence of police, and the looting done by corporations. If someone believes that ""there's nothing I can do"", forward them this email. If someone isn't comfortable talking about race, do the work to help them have that conversation. It has never been more important for us to stand against intolerance."" linktr.ee/codmanacademy:=:http://linktr.ee/codmanacademy #EdThatAddsUp #LearnLeadServe",Link,0.16,https://www.facebook.com/164760430228497/posts/3054154037955774/,13,10,4,12,10,25,29,13,4,18,569,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Whether you’ve welcomed the presence of #BroodX or deemed them as a nuisance to your outdoor activities, many have witnessed the billions of cicadas swarming the East and Midwest regions. However, Ronak Shah, a science teacher KIPP Indy Public Schools, was met with questions from his students about the eerie absence of cicadas from their Indianapolis neighborhood. Ronak knew that to honestly address his students’ concerns, they needed to learn about environmental racism, environmental injustice, and other lasting effects of the historical lines of segregation in their city.

Crenshaw is also the founder of Columbia Law School's Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies (CISPS) and the African American Policy Forum (AAPF), as well as the president of the Berlin-based Center for Intersectional Justice (CIJ). Crenshaw is known for the introduction and development of intersectionality, the theory of how overlapping or intersecting social identities, particularly minority identities, relate to systems and structures of oppression, domination, or discrimination. Her scholarship was also essential in the development of intersectional feminism which examines the overlapping systems of oppression and discrimination to which women are subject due to their ethnicity, sexuality, and economic background. #BlackHistoryMonth #VamosWarriors",Photo,-0.88,https://www.facebook.com/146815178861752/posts/1527934130749843/,6,4,5,6,1,8,11,5,0,18,155,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"More than 70 parents and community members joined Klamath County School District Superintendent Glen Szymoniak tonight (Sept. 2) on the lawn of Mazama High School for a discussion about schools and state mandates. The forum was followed by a question and answer session. As the event began, football players gathered on nearby Viking Field, warming up for an evening game. Klamath County Sheriff Chris Kaber was among the first to address the crowd, explaining he supported their right to peaceably protest but asking that those who wish to do so not disrupt the first day of school for students. Some parents wanted the school district to defy the state mask mandate, risking educators’ certifications as well as fines and loss of liability insurance. But others said it was an unacceptable risk to ask of teachers and administrators. (The state is requiring the wearing of masks inside all K-12 school buildings.) Janah Moorer, who will be a senior at Mazama when school starts next week, told the crowd she is ready to be back in the classroom fulltime after a year of distance learning and hybrid schedules. “I’m not a fan of masks, but I’m willing to make that sacrifice,” she said. For nearly 40 minutes, community members had the floor, asking questions about state mandates and how school will look for students this fall. Superintendent Glen Szymoniak then answered as many questions as time allowed. He also explained how the district will continue to advocate for local control, which would allow leaders to work with Klamath County Public Health to determine how best to handle COVID-19. Questions ranged from staffing, mask mandates and vaccination requirements for school staff to critical race theory (CRT is not part of the district’s curriculum). The school district is compiling the questions and answers and will post them on our website at www.kcsd.k12.or.us.:=:https://www.kcsd.k12.or.us/ As the meeting ended, the football game started and fans could be heard cheering. Szymoniak thanked parents and community members for taking the time to attend the town hall before joining Mazama Principal Jennifer Hawkins and heading to Viking Field to watch the students play. “We all care about our children and want our schools open,” he said. “I will always be accountable to you and listen to you. Now whether I can do everything you want? I can’t make that promise, but I can promise you that I’m going to provide you with a respectful environment so you can get your questions answered.”",Photo,-1.1,https://www.facebook.com/1406688319550986/posts/3123794961173638/,2,10,0,4,5,5,19,4,1,22,418,77,58,8,9,0,0,1,0,0,1

Congress passed and then President Joe Biden signed into law a federal holiday on June 19th, or Juneteenth, commemorating the end of enslavement in the United States. June 19, 1865 is the day that “Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation,” according to CNN. Texas became the final state to end enslavement. Juneteenth is a day that Black people have long celebrated, but that many other Americans know little to nothing about. But as it’s now recognized as a federal holiday, that will change, and I look forward to adding more information about the holiday and its history to our curriculum. To keep things real here, we as a nation simply have not properly confronted our past crimes against humanity that took place during a 250 year period in the form of human bondage, abuse, and murder. It’s long past time that our country honors the lives lost to enslavement and all the people who survived it to see their emancipation, and celebrates the triumph over this evil system that built so much of our country and its wealth through the enslavement of millions of Black lives. Of course, this move by Congress and President Biden comes amid a national reckoning with issues of race, and a terrible spike in racist behavior. It also comes as some people across the country fight against efforts to teach “critical race theory,” which gives a direct and honest accounting of the history of race and racism in our society. Martin Luther King, Jr. reminded us that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” This is one more important curve toward justice for everyone, but we still have a long way to go. Now, as the signing of the bill by the president comes just two days before the holiday it proclaims, we, the District, are unable to facilitate the holiday for our staff this year. So, Friday, June 18 is a normal work and summer learning day in OUSD. Even though tomorrow is still a work and school day in OUSD, I want to wish everyone in our community a wonderful, thoughtful, and reflective Juneteenth on Saturday as we work toward a more just society for all.

"Audre Lorde, a self-described “black, lesbian, feminist, mother, poet, warrior,"" made lasting contributions in the fields of feminist theory, critical race studies and queer theory through her pedagogy and writing. Born in New York City to Caribbean immigrants, Lorde was the first black student at Hunter High School, a public school for gifted girls. She earned degrees at Hunter College and Columbia University and worked as a librarian in New York public schools throughout the 1960s. “I write for those women who do not speak, for those who do not have a voice because they were so terrified, because we are taught to respect fear more than ourselves. We’ve been taught that silence would save us, but it won’t.” Lorde was also a professor of English at John Jay College and Hunter College, where she held the prestigious post of Thomas Hunter Chair of Literature. In 1980, Lorde, along with fellow writer Barbara Smith, founded Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, which published work by and about women of color, including Lorde’s book “I Am Your Sister: Black Women Organizing Across Sexualities” (1986). Some of Lorde’s most notable works written during this time were “Coal” (1976), “The Black Unicorn” (1978), “The Cancer Journals” (1980) and “Zami: A New Spelling of My Name” (1982)",Photo,-1.71,https://www.facebook.com/118521981540601/posts/3279024258823675/,3,12,3,7,4,13,14,11,0,13,214,14,8,1,3,2,0,0,0,0,0

"IMPORTANT UPDATE FROM THE MISSOURI SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION: Critical Race Theory and Educational Equity: What You Need to Know Questions about Critical Race Theory and its use in public schools are becoming commonplace in our communities. Two common questions being asked are 1) What is Critical Race Theory? and 2) Is it being taught in our schools? What Is Critical Race Theory? Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a phrase that is frequently mentioned in the media and in public conversations. CRT might have a certain meaning to one person while someone else might believe it is something entirely different. But the most basic purpose of Critical Race Theory, which originated in the 1970s, was as an analytical tool for law students to examine the impact of historical and present-day racism on the legal system and public policies. Currently, CRT is primarily used by higher education in the study of law, psychology, and sociology. Is Critical Race Theory in the Missouri Learning Standards? The tenets of CRT are not part of social studies or any other learning standards in Missouri. The state’s social studies standards can be found on the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s website (Missouri Social Studies Learning Standards). It’s important to remember that all Missouri Learning Standards are approved by the State Board of Education and developed by Missouri educators, parents, and other community stakeholders selected by the President Pro Tem of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the State Board of Education, the Commissioner of DESE, the Commissioner of Higher Education and various education associations. (Section 160.514, RSMo.) Is Critical Race Theory the Same as Educational Equity? No. Various media channels and members of the public sometimes use terms interchangeably when they mean two different things. The terms Critical Race Theory and educational equity are not the same. Unlike CRT, which, again, is a tool primarily used in institutions of higher education, educational equity is a K-12 term referring to federal and state policies and requirements. Specifically, the term is closely associated with “No Child Left Behind” (NCLB) legislation that was led by former President George W. Bush and signed into law in 2002. This federal law established clear requirements for school districts to not only disaggregate student achievement data by race but also to close achievements gaps where they exist. In recent years, the terms equity work or diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become commonplace in K-12 education as many districts revisit and renew their local efforts to close achievement gaps as required by the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). When signed into law in 2015, ESSA further advanced equity in U.S. education policy by upholding protections outlined in NCLB, including calling for comprehensive state-developed plans designed to close achievement gaps, improve the quality of instruction, and increase outcomes for all students. The state's accreditation system, MSIP (the Missouri School Improvement Program), includes provisions to address educational equity in Missouri’s schools. These rules were reviewed by Missouri’s Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, which is a 10-member legislative committee made up of six Republicans and four Democrats from the Missouri House and Senate. Further, the Secretary of State received comments from the public on the proposed rules and the State Board of Education considered the comments prior to final approval. Is Critical Race Theory the Same as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)?
